  <h2 class="text-center">Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    The following are the direct words written by Evelyn. No changes have been made to her original language during transcription.
    If you come across terms that feel outdated or uncomfortable, please understand they reflect the language norms of her time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Had any changes been made, this would no longer be Evelyn’s writing but rather an interpretation—something we’ve avoided
    in the interest of preserving authenticity.

  <h2 class="section-title">Childhood Memories of Fred Watts (1906–1997)</h2>
  <p>
    Around the time Fred’s niece Pam began gathering material for their family history, she suggested I ask Fred about his
    childhood in Axford, a small village near Marlborough, Wiltshire. It’s a beautiful place surrounded by hills and fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    The river, mentioned later, is only a few feet wide in places, widening into watercress beds. Hens Wood overlooks the
    village, and in spring the area was full of primroses and bluebells. Further on lay Savernake Forest, where we gathered
    wild daffodils and snowdrops.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several cottages were converted into large houses. Newcomers tried to stop locals from using a small white bridge and
    public footpaths—but they failed. When we were stopped walking to Hens Wood, we simply exchanged a few strong words
    and carried on. The locals knew their rights and stood firm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fred sang in the village’s small, damp-smelling church, surrounded by a graveyard. There was also a small chapel. Sunday
    school treats were held on the estate of Lady and Sir Ernest Wells. Their son George would gather local boys during school
    holidays and take them to play on the lake using cut-in-half beer barrels. The cook always gave them lemonade and buns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The “Red Lion” was the village pub—very old and interesting. A modern restaurant has been added. The allotments behind
    it are now grazing fields for a horse and a donkey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fred was born in a thatched cottage on Stone Lane, Axford, the home of his grandparents Philip and Sarah Haynes. All his
    siblings and cousins were born there. His grandmother was the village midwife; his mother was also a midwife and had many
    stories to tell.
  </p>

  <p>
    The thatched cottage, one of three, belonged to the Ramsbury Manor Estate and was allocated to farm workers. Fred’s father,
    a carter, cared for the horses—horses the children sometimes rode bareback. The cottage had no back door, just a front one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The downstairs had a single large room with a scrubbed red brick floor. In front of the fire sat a “West of England” corn sack,
    replaced weekly. There were no other mats. A large open fireplace held an iron cauldron, suspended by chains from a beam
    embedded in the chimney. Wood and coal were burned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Half a pig always hung on a ceiling rack. Fred’s father kept pigs in a nearby field. The butcher slaughtered a pig every six
    months, and Fred’s mother would cut meat as needed.
