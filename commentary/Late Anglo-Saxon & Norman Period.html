      <h1>Late Anglo-Saxon & Norman Period (c.1040–1154)</h1>
      <p>
        This early period was marked by the end of Anglo-Saxon England and the
        dramatic upheaval of the Norman Conquest in 1066. For families living in
        England, this meant a shift in rulers, landownership, and even language.
        The Normans introduced new systems of governance and castle building,
        and land was redistributed to loyal followers of William the Conqueror.

      <p>
        In Ireland, life continued under native Gaelic rule, relatively
        untouched by these events — for the time being.
