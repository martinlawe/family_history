      <h1>EEC/EU Membership and Modernization (1973–1998)</h1>
      <p>
        Overview: Joining the EEC (later EU) brought funding and infrastructure
        improvements. Education, health care, and women’s rights advanced.
        However, the Troubles in Northern Ireland overshadowed politics. County
        Kilkenny: Investment improved rural roads and farms. Heritage tourism
        expanded with attention to Kilkenny Castle and St. Canice’s Cathedral.
        Small industry and crafts (like pottery and design) flourished.
