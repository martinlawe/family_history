      <h1>Post-War Ireland and Social Change (1950â€“1973)</h1>
      <p>
        Overview: Ireland remained neutral during WWII. The 1950s saw hardship
        and high emigration. In the 1960s, economic modernization began, and
        Ireland prepared to join the EEC (joined 1973). County Kilkenny: Young
        people continued to leave for England and the US. Some industrial
        development arrived in Kilkenny City, and tourism began to increase due
        to its medieval history and heritage.
