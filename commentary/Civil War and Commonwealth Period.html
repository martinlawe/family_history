			<p>Civil war shattered the old order in England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>
			<p>Divided by religion and politics, families chose — or were forced — to side with either Royalists or Parliamentarians. 
			The war’s aftermath saw the execution of Charles I and the rise of Oliver Cromwell, whose campaigns in Ireland were especially brutal, leading to land confiscations and widespread hardship. 
			It was a time of loss, but also one in which older structures of power began to break down.</p>
