      <h1>Civil War and Commonwealth (1642–1660)</h1>

      <p>
        Civil war shattered the old order in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divided by religion and politics, families chose — or were forced — to
        side with either Royalists or Parliamentarians. The war’s aftermath saw
        the execution of Charles I and the rise of Oliver Cromwell, whose
        campaigns in Ireland were especially brutal, leading to land
        confiscations and widespread hardship. It was a time of loss, but also
        one in which older structures of power began to break down.
