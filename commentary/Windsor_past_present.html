        Windsor has undergone significant change over the years, including the
        loss of entire streets and communities. This section aims to recover
        some of that lost landscape by identifying where earlier locations once
        stood in relation to present-day landmarks (as of 2025), and by
        documenting who lived there, in the context of our family story. We rely
        on confirmed sources such as census records and, to some extent,
        digitised church records, to ensure accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our earliest recorded dwelling of a family member, excluding the
        D'oyly's and the Brocas', would be William Vickers, born in 1806 in
        Windsor. In the 1841 census, William is recorded living in Duke's Head
        Yard. This is believed to have been at the rear of the Duke’s Head
        public house, which stood on the corner of Oxford Road and Peascod
        Street—now the site of Creams, an Italian Gelato establishment. By 1851,
        William had moved to Garden Court, located where the River Street Car
        Park stands today, with probable access from Alexandra Gardens, beside
        the current Bowling Green.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we look at Henry Vickers. Born in 1840, he would have lived in
        Duke's Head Yard until the family moved to Garden Court. He remained
        there until his marriage in 1865. In 1871, he is found living with his
        in-laws, but by 1881, he had moved to 61 Victoria Cottages, Edward
        Square.
      </p>
      <p>
        Henry's youngest son, Albert (born 1890), lived at 61 Victoria Cottages,
        Edward Square with his elder brother James after Henry's death in 1909.
        Following his marriage to Rachel Brown in 1919, Albert Vickers moved
        first to 66 Victoria Cottages and later to Clewer Fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth noting that Victoria Cottages stood on the north side of
        Edward Square. Edward Square, along with Denmark Street, Grosvenor
        Place, Goswell Road, and Oxford Road, are all now part of the Ward Royal
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another branch of the family are the Browns. Isaac Brown was born in
        Windsor in 1817. He married in Wantage in 1841, and by 1851 was living
        in Grove Cottages, Love Lane, with his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Brown lived in Love Lane in 1901, probably at No. 5 Wellington
        Square, which was off Love Lane. The family moved to various locations
        in Windsor, many are still being investigated, however we do know that
        Love Lane, Wellington Square, and Keppel Street were demolished to make
        way for the extension to Victoria Barracks around 1906. Rachel Brown,
        daughter of John, was living in Wellington Square in 1901 at the age of
        four. She married Albert Vickers in 1919, and went on to live in
        Victoria Cottages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lawrence side of the family does not have the same long-standing
        connection with Windsor. The earliest record is the 1891 census, which
        shows Matilda Archer (nee Fowler) living in Sydney Place with her
        husband Thomas Archer (they married in 1890). By 1901, they had moved to
        8 Victoria Cottages, Edward Square. By 1917, the family had moved to 10
        Keppel Row, Sun Passage. Around 1925, Matilda was still living in Keppel
        Row, and it was here that her daughter Emily returned to after time
        away. Emily later moved to 4 Alma Cottages, where her son Leslie was
        born in August 1925. Matilda moved at some point before 1939 to 4 Helena
        Cottages, Clewer Fields. Helena Cottages no longer exist, but they once
        stood in Clewer Fields, along the footpath that now leads to Beaumont
        Cottages. They were situated on the east side of the path, while
        Napoleon Cottages—still standing today—remain on the west side. Helena
        Cottages were later demolished and replaced by new terraced housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve explored several key locations connected with the family in
        Windsor. Keppel Row was situated in Sun Passage, which connects Peascod
        Street (to the north) with Victoria Street (to the south). That site is
        now the car park outside the library on the west side. Alma Cottages
        were at the western end of South Place, with access from Alma Road. The
        location is now where the entrance lies to the car park behind "The
        Hope" public house on Alma Road. Helena Cottages can be found in Clewer
        Fields which is a quiet, pedestrian-only footpath in Windsor, running
        east to west between Alma Road and Vansitart Road. It lies just beyond
        Ward Royal, west of Peascod Street, and runs parallel to both Oxford
        Road (to the north) and Bexley Street (to the south). The current
        houses, all situated on the north side of the path, were built circa
        1890 following the demolition of older cottages as part of a slum
        clearance scheme in the late 19th century. The lane retains its
        enclosed, residential feel, with no vehicular access..
      </p>
      <p>
        As a historical footnote, the family’s connection to Windsor stretches
        even further back. Robert D’Oyly, brother of Nigel D’Oyly, is recorded
        as having assisted in the construction of Windsor Castle in 1068.
