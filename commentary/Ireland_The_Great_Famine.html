      <h1>The Great Famine and its Aftermath (1845–1870)</h1>
      <p>
        Overview: The Great Famine (1845–1852) devastated Ireland. Over a
        million died and another million emigrated, particularly to Britain and
        North America. Political unrest grew alongside demands for land reform
        and national self-determination.

      <em>County Kilkenny:</em>
      <p>
        The Famine struck hard. Although not as severely as in the west,
        Kilkenny suffered significant loss of life and population decline
        through emigration. Workhouses and soup kitchens became widespread.
