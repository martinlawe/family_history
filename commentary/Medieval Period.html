      <p>
        This was a time of kings, castles, and feudal duties, but also plague
        and war.

        England saw great social and political change, especially following the
        Black Death, which reduced the population and opened new opportunities
        for surviving families. The Magna Carta laid early foundations for
        limits on royal power.

        In Ireland, the Anglo-Norman invasion brought centuries of conflict and
        shifting control between native Irish lords and English settlers. Life
        for most was shaped by rural labour, the Church, and shifting loyalties.
