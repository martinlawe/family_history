		<p>This was a time of kings, castles, and feudal duties, but also plague and war.</p> 
		<p>England saw great social and political change, especially following the Black Death, which reduced the population and opened new opportunities for surviving families. 
		The Magna Carta laid early foundations for limits on royal power.</p>
		<p>In Ireland, the Anglo-Norman invasion brought centuries of conflict and shifting control between native Irish lords and English settlers. 
		Life for most was shaped by rural labour, the Church, and shifting loyalties.</p>
