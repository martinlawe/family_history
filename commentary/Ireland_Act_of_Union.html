      <h1>Act of Union and Early 19th Century (1801–1845) Overview:</h1>
      <p>
        The Act of Union (1801) created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
        Ireland. Irish MPs were sent to Westminster, and Dublin lost its status
        as a national capital. Catholic emancipation became a major political
        issue, led by Daniel O’Connell.

      <em>County Kilkenny:</em>
      <p>
        Agriculture dominated, with small tenant farms and landlord estates.
        Kilkenny City retained a modest administrative and trading role.
        Tensions around land ownership and Catholic rights were growing.
