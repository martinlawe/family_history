      <h1>Restoration and Enlightenment (1660â€“c.1750)</h1>
      <p>
        After years of conflict, the monarchy returned under Charles II, but the
        balance of power had shifted forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a period of relative stability, especially in England, with the
        growth of cities, trade, and early science.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In Ireland</strong>, however, the Protestant Ascendancy was
        firmly established, and Penal Laws restricted the rights of Catholics
        and dissenting Protestants. For families in both countries, the early
        18th century was a time of tightening social control, but also the
        beginnings of literacy, migration, and commercial opportunity.
