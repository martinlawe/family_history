      <h1>World War Period</h1>

      <p><em>The World War Period in the UK and Ireland(1914 - 1945)</em></p>

      <p>
        The first half of the 20th century was dominated by two devastating
        world wars that shaped every aspect of life in the UK and Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>World War I (1914–1918)</strong> pulled in millions of men from
        Britain and Ireland to fight on the Western Front and beyond. Families
        were shattered by loss, and even those who returned were often changed
        by the experience. On the home front, women stepped into roles
        previously closed to them, a change that would slowly alter social
        expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Ireland, the war years overlapped with political upheaval. The Easter
        Rising of 1916, the subsequent War of Independence (1919–1921), and the
        Civil War (1922–1923) led to the partition of Ireland and the creation
        of the Irish Free State. These events divided communities and families,
        particularly in the North, where tensions remained high
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>World War II (1939–1945)</strong> again brought mobilisation and
        loss. Britain faced bombing raids, rationing, evacuation of children,
        and a total war effort that reached into every home. Ireland remained
        officially neutral but was deeply affected by the conflict — through the
        service of Irish volunteers in British forces, through wartime
        shortages, and through the political balancing act of neutrality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout this period, families adapted to constant change,
        uncertainty, and sacrifice. Many experienced dislocation, whether
        through death, evacuation, or emigration. The wars also led to the
        expansion of the welfare state in Britain, reshaping everyday life in
        their aftermath.
