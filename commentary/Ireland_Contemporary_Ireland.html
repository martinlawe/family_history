      <h1>Contemporary Ireland (2010â€“Present)</h1>
      <p>
        Overview: A slow but steady recovery followed the crash. Ireland became
        more socially progressive (e.g., same-sex marriage referendum, 2015).
        Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have brought new challenges. County
        Kilkenny: Tourism and the arts remain strong. The city has a reputation
        for craft, festivals, and medieval heritage. Farming remains important
        but is increasingly mechanized and environmentally conscious.
