<body>
  1. Act of Union and Early 19th Century (1801–1845) Overview: The Act of Union
  (1801) created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish MPs were
  sent to Westminster, and Dublin lost its status as a national capital.
  Catholic emancipation became a major political issue, led by Daniel O’Connell.
  County Kilkenny: Agriculture dominated, with small tenant farms and landlord
  estates. Kilkenny City retained a modest administrative and trading role.
  Tensions around land ownership and Catholic rights were growing. 2. The Great
  Famine and its Aftermath (1845–1870) Overview: The Great Famine (1845–1852)
  devastated Ireland. Over a million died and another million emigrated,
  particularly to Britain and North America. Political unrest grew alongside
  demands for land reform and national self-determination. County Kilkenny: The
  Famine struck hard. Although not as severely as in the west, Kilkenny suffered
  significant loss of life and population decline through emigration. Workhouses
  and soup kitchens became widespread. 3. Land War and Nationalist Movements
  (1870–1914) Overview: The Irish Land Wars and Home Rule campaigns gained
  momentum. Tenant farmers began to buy land from landlords under a series of
  reforms. Cultural revival movements in language, sport, and literature helped
  forge a stronger Irish identity. County Kilkenny: The GAA (founded 1884)
  became important here—hurling was especially strong in Kilkenny. Land reform
  improved security for tenant farmers, and the region participated in
  nationalist politics. 4. Revolutionary Period (1916–1923) Overview: A
  turbulent period including the Easter Rising (1916), War of Independence
  (1919–1921), and Civil War (1922–1923). The Anglo-Irish Treaty created the
  Irish Free State in 1922, but led to deep divisions. County Kilkenny: Local
  IRA units were active during the War of Independence. The Civil War saw bitter
  local conflicts. Some residents remained loyal to the Crown, while others
  supported the new Free State or anti-Treaty forces. 5. The Free State and
  Early Republic (1923–1949) Overview: After the Civil War, the Irish Free State
  stabilized under Cumann na nGaedheal and later Fianna Fáil. Ireland gradually
  moved away from British influence, eventually becoming a republic in 1949.
  County Kilkenny: Economic stagnation and emigration continued. Rural
  electrification and road improvements slowly reached the area. Farming
  remained the dominant way of life. 6. Post-War Ireland and Social Change
  (1950–1973) Overview: Ireland remained neutral during WWII. The 1950s saw
  hardship and high emigration. In the 1960s, economic modernization began, and
  Ireland prepared to join the EEC (joined 1973). County Kilkenny: Young people
  continued to leave for England and the US. Some industrial development arrived
  in Kilkenny City, and tourism began to increase due to its medieval history
  and heritage. 7. EEC/EU Membership and Modernization (1973–1998) Overview:
  Joining the EEC (later EU) brought funding and infrastructure improvements.
  Education, health care, and women’s rights advanced. However, the Troubles in
  Northern Ireland overshadowed politics. County Kilkenny: Investment improved
  rural roads and farms. Heritage tourism expanded with attention to Kilkenny
  Castle and St. Canice’s Cathedral. Small industry and crafts (like pottery and
  design) flourished. 8. Celtic Tiger and Crash (1998–2010) Overview: Ireland
  experienced rapid economic growth (1995–2008), dubbed the “Celtic Tiger.”
  Immigration increased for the first time in centuries. The global financial
  crash of 2008 brought severe economic hardship. County Kilkenny: The building
  boom led to housing developments in and around Kilkenny City. The crash
  affected rural construction and employment. Some emigration returned. 9.
  Contemporary Ireland (2010–Present) Overview: A slow but steady recovery
  followed the crash. Ireland became more socially progressive (e.g., same-sex
  marriage referendum, 2015). Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic have brought new
  challenges. County Kilkenny: Tourism and the arts remain strong. The city has
  a reputation for craft, festivals, and medieval heritage. Farming remains
  important but is increasingly mechanized and environmentally conscious.
