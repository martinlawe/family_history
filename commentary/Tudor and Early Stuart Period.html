      <h1>Tudor and Early Stuart Period (1485–1649)</h1>
      <p>
        The Tudors brought strong monarchy, religious turmoil, and major changes
        to land and church life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reformation reshaped beliefs and parish structures, and many
        monasteries — long custodians of local records and land — were
        dissolved. Families found themselves caught between Catholic and
        Protestant divides, especially in Ireland, where English plantations and
        confiscations displaced native landowners. This was also the age of
        growing state control, overseas exploration, and early education
        reforms.
