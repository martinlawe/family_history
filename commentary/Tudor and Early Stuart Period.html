          The Tudors brought strong monarchy, religious turmoil, and major
          changes to land and church life.

          The Reformation reshaped beliefs and parish structures, and many
          monasteries — long custodians of local records and land — were
          dissolved. Families found themselves caught between Catholic and
          Protestant divides, especially in Ireland, where English plantations
          and confiscations displaced native landowners. This was also the age
          of growing state control, overseas exploration, and early education
          reforms.
