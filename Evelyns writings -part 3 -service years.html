    <p>The following are the direct wordings used by Evelyn, in her writings. I have not made any changes to the wording used, in my transcription. Therefore, I
    will apologise, in advance if you find anything here upsetting. It must be remembered that when Evelyn wrote this, the terminology used
    was acceptable. It should also be noted, that had I made any changes, this then would not be Evelyn’s writings, but a variation on those writings, with my interpretations.</p>

<h2 class = "section-title">My Years in Domestic Service  l933 to l943</h2>

On my 13th birthday I realised I had only one more year at school, then I was to go into service. That last year could not pass quickly enough for me. I did
not care much for school. History I liked best of all but can only remember one date, The Battle of Hastings 1066. Henry VIII fascinated me and I could never 
learn enough about his reign. My school Clewer St.Stephens was the best school in Windsor. Its Headmistress Miss Butterworth was a demon. Most girls were scared of her. 
Some teachers disliked her. I remember once when my last teacher, Miss Johns was away sick, Miss Butterworth took my class 6B for English. We had to
learn a part of Macbeth which goes — ”Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle towards my hand, come let me clutch thee. I have thee not and yet I see thee still. 
Art thou but a vision, etc. ” Miss Butterworth said it through to us and really scared us stiff. We were glad when Miss Johns returned. She was by far the better
teacher. She confiscated our sweets if we were caught eating in class and we were always being given lines. Mostly 100. Mine mostly were ”I must not talk in class”. 
When very bad we sat in the hall on the floor cross legged. My gymslip had a large patch at the back. The A side of the school was mostly for girls going into office 
work. The B side was for domestic and other work. Clewer St. Stephens was a very strict school. Uniforms had to be worn. White blouse, green and yellow tie, navy blue 
gymslip, navy blue knickers (with a pocket) and black shoes and stockings. Shoes had to be changed in the cloakroom and plimsolls put on. In winter we wore navy blue 
coats and hats with a badge in front. In summer we wore panama hats with a badge. Woe betide any girl caught not wearing a hat. When my sister reached senior school 
black stockings had been changed to white socks. I well remember one morning when I went to school in a jumper as my one and only blouse wasn't ironed and I was made 
to stand up in the Hall whilst everyone else sat down and was really told off. I only had the one blouse which had to be washed, dried and ironed the night before
school. My sister had two blouses when I left school. As we were poor we three had to go to St. Michael‘s Home in Dorset Road with other girls for our mid-day meal. 
We hated having to walk in a crocodile I sat next to Sister Howe who always gave me the fat off her meat. I hated fat but always ate it being too scared to refuse it.’ 
She suggested that on leaving I went to be trained for service. So Mother, Sister Howe and myself went by train to Clapham Common to a private school. The staff were 
all the ‘Home' girls, cheap labour. ' Everywhere in the servants quarters were large signs, Silence, No Talking. The servants always hurried. A depressing place. 
At the interview I couldn't stop crying and begged Mother not to leave me there. She didn’t like the place either. Sister Howe wasn‘t very pleased when Mother said No 
I was not going there, and she never suggested another ”place” In the evenings when Mother wasn't too tired she would tell us of her years in service before she married.
She worked in a large establishment with many servants,  ladies maids, and some even kept cows and hens. One old cowman, Amos, always gave my Mother cream to drink. 
Dairy maids were kept. My Mother worked in the kitchen with her sister. They lived well but had to work hard. They had one day off a month when they came home to Windsor 
and gave most of their wages to their Mother. A Mrs. Allen who kept a Registry Office<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>
<span id="fn1" class="footnote-content">The agency was actually "The Servants Registry Agency"</span> in Thames Street where the King George Memorial is now always got my Mother her jobs 
so I was taken there. 
</p>
<p>I applied for and got a house parlour-maid's job to the Organist at St. George’s Chapel in the Cloisters at Windsor Castle<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>
<span id="fn1" class="footnote-content">Actually No. 12 Horseshoe Cloisters, Windsor Castle, Windsor, SL4 1NJ..</span>. A Cook was the other servant kept. I had two 
of everything to go into service with, I exchanged one uniform for another. In the household was Dr. (later Sir) and Mrs. Harris and their younger daughter Miss Ann Patricia 
but called Miss Squibs. Miss Margaret being away at school at Calne. She came home for holidays. Miss Squibs was a 10 year old plump child who always seemed to wear fairisle 
jumpers and a kilt. 
</p>
<p>Her socks were knitted by the cook, Dorothy, who never seemed to be without her knitting needles in her hands. When Madam went out shopping I would be called from my work 
upstairs to clean the kitchen, scullery and pantry. Dorothy would stand by the window with her knitting and watch for Madam to come through the archway when she would send me 
back upstairs. I would then be told off by Madam when she came in for not working fast enough. I never answered back.</p>
<p>It was a large rambling tall house. The hall seemed miles long when I had to polish the red tiles on my knees. The four or five long stone steps leading upstairs were 
cleaned with cold starch water and hearth stone, no small wonder my hands were always covered with bleeding chaps. I was allowed to go off duty tor an hour every afternoon. 
My half day every week and every other Sunday was from 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock. Should Madam discover any dust when she went round the house with a hairpin in a white handkerchief 
my half day was stopped and I had to clean the inside of the windows instead. They were long leaded windows. How I hated them.</p>
<p>Miss Squib was forever snatching off my mob-cap and hiding it. I would then be told off for not wearing it. I kept quiet. The servants toilet was outside by the coal shed. 
A creepy walk when it was dark carrying the large key. The Curfew Tower was only a few feet away and my imagination would run riot. I still went to Sunday School every other Sunday. 
I was then in the ‘Bible Class at the Baptist Church. We were Baptists my Grandmother was a &quot;daily” at the home of Mrs. Baxter. Her son was the organist at the Baptist Church. 
(He later married a Miss Oliver a Sunday School teacher the day war broke out, Sept.l939).</p>
<p>Often I had to take Miss Squib to the Eton Recreation field instead of going off duty. A previous maid had left her stranded there and returned to her home in Eton Wick never to return. 
No one it seemed stayed long. In the coal shed were names and dates of previous house parlour-maid's. I added mine in due course. Work there was really hard. No modern cleaners in those days, 
long stiff brooms for sweeping carpets. The dust flew everywhere. My knees were soon like leather with so much kneeling. One spring—cleaning time Mrs. Harris hired an electric hoover. 
The man came to demonstrate how to use it using sand to show how it sucked up the dirt. After  spring~cleaning it was sent back.</p> 
<p>The cellar though never used was cleaned every so often. I was sure that the cellar was haunted. The light switch was outside the door and of course if Miss Squib was around and I was down 
in the cellar she'd turn off the light-and lock the door. Often I was cleaning silver at 9 o‘clock at night. For all this I was paid £14 a year, £1.3.4d a month (£1.17p) and was often told I 
was never worth it. Though not happy there I was told by Mother and Mrs. Allen I had to stay for 2 years to get a reference. I stayed nearly two years leaving during the summer holiday and 
went to Wotton House, Eton College where I was paid £16 a year as under house—maid on the private side.</p>
<p>I had bought more uniform while at Dr. Harris‘s house mostly from Miss Bird‘s shop in Lower Peascod Street. She was a Methodist and held a weekly meeting called The Band of White Ribboners. 
She sold maids uniforms, morning and afternoon aprons cost l/lld, mob—caps 6 3/4d, afternoon caps 9d. My black stockings from Ethel Wiles shop in Oxford Road cost 6 3/4d a pair. When I had more 
money I bought a brand called ”Fearless” that had double knees and heels. I helped wait at table in the boys hall for breakfast, lunch and sometimes supper. At my previous place I had my own room, 
now I shared with the third parlour-maid. Our room was through two attics. Very creepy. The long window looked out towards the Bath Road to Slough. It was a pleasant room in summer but in the 
winter the ice formed on our water jugs on our washstands.</p>
<p>We were not allowed to light a fire and our blankets were very thin so we froze at night. My Mother bought me a flock eiderdown for a Christmas present. Once or twice I took a few knobs of coal 
and made firelighters from newspapers. (One of my jobs was making firelighters, no sticks for fires) and we had a fire. It was lovely we covered the glass panels on our bedroom door and laid a mat 
across the bottom so no one could see see the flickering fire. We were never found out.</p>
<p> War broke out while I was there. It didn’t make a lot of difference to us except our light bulbs were changed for much dimmer ones. We were already on rations for sugar, 1/2lb weekly and 
butter 1/4lb weekly. I always had plenty of mending to do in the afternoons l was on duty. Staff sheets when thin were turned sides to middle, then top to bottom, after that they were made into 
under pillow slips, from them to slop cloths and then rags. Nothing was ever wasted. The head housemaids never stayed long. Work was done the hard way. The Dame was a tyrant, always seemed to have 
her finger on the bell button. Her evening clothes were laid out on the bed every evening after tea by the Head housemaid. When I did it on the Head‘s afternoon off, I sometimes forgot to put her 
evening bag and handkerchief out, so, on the bell she pushed in her sitting room and up a parlour-maid would run several flights of stairs to answer the bell only to be told that it was me that was 
wanted. Up I would go and was told off to fetch the bag and the handkerchief which I took into the sitting room on a silver salver. The sitting room was four doors along from her bedroom'.</p>
<p>Would she get the same treatment these days? It was the Head Housemaids honour to mend her clothes, I cleaned her shoes, using milk to clean her patent leather ones. One Head Housemaid I remember 
well, she was old, couldn't get up in the mornings at 6 o‘clock. I was down at least a 1/4 hour before that. We worked by the clock and I had to help her do her work as well as my own. Winter was 
the worst time when the coal fires were on. The brass canopies and fenders got discoloured as soon as the fires were lit and took a lot of hard rubbing to clean. The rind of a lemon helped a lot. 
From Kathleen I learned a lot. She’d been around a long time. Furniture supposed to be polished every day(no spray on polishes those days) just got a rub over and a tiny bit of polish was put on the 
fire throwing out the smell of polish. My job was the cleaning out of fires, blackleading them every morning} sweeping the carpets with a long handled stiff broom, polishing floors and cleaning the 
washstands. Even if the bathroom was next.to the bedrooms, chambers and washstands were used. The Dames ivory figures were supposed to be washed in milk. They weren‘t. Carpets had used tea leaves 
sprinkled on them to hold back the dust and bring out the colours. Kathleen also stuck china ornaments she broke with the white of eggs. She was also supposed to do the Dame‘s mending. When she left 
it was discovered pushed to the back of the drawer. She didn't stay long.</p>
<p>We were not well fed. Sunday breakfast was one very tasty sausage. When the boys had a roast joint the head parlourmaid would quickly carve some slices off for our tea hiding it in a serviette. 
I can still remember the roast pork. Delicious. One night we were really hungry so we three young ones (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> parlourmaids and myself) crept down the many flights of 
stairs and raided the larder. One saucer contained 6 peas, we left one.</p>
<p>Next day the cook was mad. The boys got the blame. We were never suspected but we never did it again. One cook we had was really mean with our food. We didn't even get any jam for our tea. 
During one spring cleaning we heard the cook had died. It appeared she had a Boarding House at Bexhill on Sea and had been supplying her house with food and goods meant for us. The Dame of course 
had been sent for and was n't very happy to have to leave her holiday cottage in Taunton. It was during her discovery of linen under the cook's bed that the railway porter came for a trunk 
bringing back an empty one, a weekly event.</p>
<p>The cook's son who had also arrived was really gone to town on. We learnt then that was the reason our food had been so poor and bed linen and tea towels had disappeared from the laundry baskets. 
I don’t know how it ended up after the Dame had laid down the law.</p>
<p>Every year the Dame had many tickets given to her to pass on to the staff to attend a dance in Eton behind the Post Office. How we young ones longed to go, but no, the Dame said only the boys' maids 
could go as it was too late for us to be out as we had to be up early the next morning. Our half days were from 2.30 to 9.30. The boys’ maids took the tickets but never went. We three decided we would 
go but the problem was how.? Most nights the boys got out but their friends let them in. The night watch patrolled at set times, punching a ”tell—tale” clock on each floor. The only way out for us was 
by the fire escape, through our two attics, creeping past the scullery maids and head parlourmaids rooms, past the staff bathroom and through a very long attic to the fire escape. The iron ladder had no 
hand rails until it reached the boys landing. When I saw that fire escape a few years ago I shuddered. I never realized how dangerous it was then or how very brave or stupid we all were. On reaching the 
small platform by each boys landing window we had to make sure the Dame and Tutor were not around. They each went into the boys rooms every night to say good—night. The end of the fire escape was a good 
six feet from the ground but we managed. We enjoyed the dance but my boy friend who I had fallen out with refused to help us get back on the fire escape. My friends had not been able to find a fellow to 
help us so we decided to try to move the large dustbins and climb up on them. We failed to move any of them so had to ring the bell at the back door. The night watch let us in putting our names down in 
the book. Next morning the boys knew all about it. While serving their breakfasts many boys commented on the fact that we got caught, they never did. The Tutor put flour and salt on the window sills 
thinking that was how the boys went out and returned. They had a key to their door besides a friend to let them in. We had decided to stick together. If one got the sack the other two would leave also.</p>
<p>The Dame was furious with us but staff were hard to get so she wrote to our Mothers instead of sacking us.</p>
<p>The years passed and when the last head housemaid left I asked once again if I could be considered for the post. I was 22 years old then. I’d done the job so often with no extra pay. I was refused, 
probably I was too useful as I was so I gave notice. I was getting £20 a year. No more was I going to keep sweeping up the Laburnam flowers that kept blowing in through the Dame's bathroom window or 
answer the everlasting ringing of her bedroom bell. I decided my next job would be as a parlourmaid, I‘d had enough training. My friend and her sister who worked in another house had gone back to their 
village in Durham, their Mother being worried about the guns etc here. We spent a lot of time in the air—raid shelter in the field next to our house. I had spent some summer holidays up north with my 
friends and got on well with their family so I decided to go with them. They made me welcome but of course I had to get a job My friends went into an ammunition factory at Aycliffe. I did not want to 
join them so went as parlourmaid to Mr. Nimmo, a Brewer at Castle Eden. An elderly gentleman, a teetotaller. His daughter Joan was housekeeper. Another daughter had evacuated herself to the house along 
with her husband, child and nanny.</p>
<p>Life would have been a lot easier had the two women got together before issuing orders. I knew my job and often had to &quot;dig my heels in”. Often the dining room was used for nursery tea parties.</p>
<p>l was expected to clear it away and wash up. I stuck out and when nearly dinner time came around the Nanny realizing I wasn't cleaning it up had to do it. She must have thought I was soft but soon 
found out I wasn't. I always pointed out there was a schoolroom available but then she knew she would have to clean that up.</p>
<p>Finally the Nanny was called up and Mrs. Mac.— had another baby and a Scotch Nanny. We were all up in arms about her. She insisted on hanging the baby‘s dripping washing on lines in the kitchen though 
there was the house laundry only a few feet away from the house run by an old servant. Alice with help from the daily helpers. Alice's Father had been the Master‘s Coachman many years before.</p>
<p>One evening during a dinner party the children were both yelling. The Nanny being out. The parents took no notice. The housemaid refused to go to the nursery so I went up to the children in between 
serving the dinner and sang to them My voice never was very melodious but they finally went to sleep. The atmosphere was bad. The Nanny left and the ”Blue Nanny&quot; came back. She had been called up for 
the WAAFS but got her discharge as she was pregnant. One way of getting out of the services. She in time bought up her child with the other two children. It was the best job I’d ever had. I got £1 week and 
my uniform provided, even grey stockings. The food was good, best I‘d ever had. The Master went shooting on his friends estate am; there was no shortage of meat. There was also a pig kept. One had just been 
slaughtered who was called Eileen. Every time she was served in the dining room they reminisced on her life. Many were the stories I heard. The gardener. under-gardener and boy looked after the gardens, 
lawns and greenhouses. The black and green grapes hung in huge bunches. Thinnings of grapes were made into pies and served up on Whit Sundays.</p>
<p>The house stood in the centre of a wood. Very dark and quiet it was going through it on my half days but I was never afraid. The gardener’s bungalow was on the edge by the small gate we used..</p>
<p>In Spring the wood was full of daffodils. We servants were allowed to pick a bunch to take home on our half days. The gardener always kept potted plants in tiers in the large entrance hall. 
The daffodil bulbs were later planted in the wood.</p>
<p>One job the garden boy disliked was the finding and digging out of a rabbit borrow a Sealyham dog which belonged to another daughter who often visited with her Children and nanny. The dog being so small 
always managed to get stuck. Our dogs a Scotty and a spaniel were too big.</p>
<p>A passage was reinforced into an air—raid shelter. The Master would put on his tin hat and patrol on the lawn during an air raid. We often saw the sky lit up when the towns were bombed. 
Stockton, Middlesborough, Hartlepool. Then we would just sit and wait hoping we would be missed. I would have our dogs on my lap much to Mrs. Macs- annoyance. She said I should be nursing her children. 
I preferred dogs.'. One night returning from my half day after an air raid 1 was going through the little gate into the wood when a voice shouted &quot;Halt, who goes there”. 
A soldier came from behind a haystack. Apparently a parachute had come down in the area from a hit German plane. The Soldier escorted me to our back door. Soldiers were billeted in the Village. 
We had officers. A whisky drinking Colonel one time. After a while with stocks going down I was told to say there was no more whisky. The Officers Batman came every day to clean their officers uniforms 
and equipment. Mrs. Macs~ husband who was an Army Captain, something to do with the docks at Hartlepool expected the Batman to clean for him as well. The Batmen expected to be paid. They weren’t so they 
&quot;never had time&quot; after the first time- I was then expected to do it. After holding out for a long time I condescended to give it a &quot;rub over”. Eventually he had to do it himself. -New uniforms 
were made for us in pink and white cotton for mornings. A maroon dress for afternoons. I had a frill on my morning and afternoon caps. Our aprons were large with bows at the back. we never gave up coupons.</p>
<p>Spring cleaning was hard work. We had a daily help. The attic floor was scrubbed white. It contained a lot of beautiful black oak furniture} one of the Master‘s three wives collected it. There were also 
trunks of school clothes and civvy clothes belonging to the only son to survive out of 19 children but then was killed in the first world war. Five girls also survived. In one large spare bedroom were cupboards 
full of silver cups and cutlery belonging to all the children. These were cleaned once a year. The house had many cups and large silver table lamps as well as a huge wooden crate containing old fashioned silver
urns, brushes and combs. I only ever got as far as the top layer.</p>
<p>The cook baked bread and cakes for the week on Fridays. The bread in tins was placed on the fender of the cooking range. Oh, yes, at spring cleaning carpets were cleaned by the housemaid, daily and myself on the 
lawn. The men servants would carry them out and lay them down on the lawn. We beat them then the carpets would be pulled over and beaten again. Then we all pulled them over the lawn.</p>
<p>I attended the Primitive Methodist Church in Station Town and the Salvation Army. I was in a ”Peace” play at the Methodist Church representing Portugal. I was given time off for practices and the giving of it.</p>
<p>After two years my call up papers arrived. Had I worked in the Brewery part~time I wouldn't have been called up. The Master gave me extra pay, said I was the best parlour~maid he'd had and promised me my job back 
after the war. I didn‘t drink, kept the wine cellar door locked and only gave the men their one bottle of beer for their 10 o’clock break. I was sorry to leave but had no choice. I came back to Windsor to work for 
McMichael’s in Slough and so ended my 10 years in service. I never went back to Castle Eden except to visit.</p>
