        <h1>Late Anglo-Saxon & Norman Period (c.1040–1154)</h1>
		<div class="ancestor-card">  <!-- Change Class if necessary -->		

		<p>This early period was marked by the end of Anglo-Saxon England and the dramatic upheaval of the Norman Conquest in 1066. 
		For families living in England, this meant a shift in rulers, landownership, and even language. 
		The Normans introduced new systems of governance and castle building, and land was redistributed to loyal followers of William the Conqueror.</p> 
		<p>In Ireland, life continued under native Gaelic rule, relatively untouched by these events — for the time being.</p>
