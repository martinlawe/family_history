                  between bridges 5 and 6. Relief complete at 11.45pm.<br />
                  Orderly Room was established on the Canal Bank. Enemy was
                  quiet during relief but a M.G. caused some annoyance
                  enfilading front line. Klaxon horns were established at H.Q.
                  DAWSON, CITY, SPAHI FARM and the WILLOWS for the purpose of
                  giving the alarm in event of a gas attack.<br />
                  It is difficult to describe the trenches taken over as a
                  'line'. There is nothing continuos in connection about them.
                  Winter and the apparent supemacy of hostile artillery are
                  responsible for this. Both front and Support trenches consist
                  now only of isolated posts - sections of trenches which by
                  good fortune have escaped annihilation. In front in near and
                  on either side of these sections, the ground is literally one
                  series of shell craters. Each now a pool. The earth is often
                  unnatural constency through the frequent explosion of shells
                  and becmes a kind of quicksand after rain.<br />
                  The parapet where it exists is mostly waist high, never
                  higher, and the ground in front where the theoretical ‘furrow
                  ditch’ should be is a lake varying from a few inches to
                  several feet. There are no communication trenches in the
                  sector and all troops are confined to their positions during
                  daylight. The two great problems — in fact the only problems —
                  in reconstructing the line are first drainage and second
                  uninterrupted artillery supremacy

                  sides with daylight. Enemy fire was chiefly confined to Canal

                  enemy at 2.40pm.<br />
                  Enemy shelled D.22 with whizzbangs at 3.40pm but stopped on
                  retaliatory fire being opened, no damage was reported.
                  Telephone wires to C<sub>oy</sub> H.Q. were broken during the
                  shelling and some difficulty was experienced in maintaining
                  communication. Conciderable aircraft activity all day on both
                  sides.

                  alarmed by something, threw 4 bombs - no casualties and
                  hurriedly withdrew. Patrols reported all quiet on the front.
