                  To assist operations of V<sup>t</sup>h Corps at ST ELOI,
                  Battn. stood to at 4am and opened rapid rifle and M.G. fire in
                  conjuction with bombardment of enemy lines by covering
                  artillery. Enemny immediately responded with Artillery of all
                  calibres and heavy M.G and rifle fire. This was kept up until
                  4.45am when enemy fire ceased and situation became normal
                  shortly afterwards. During the day enemy was very quiet but
                  watchful. Battalion relieved by 12 R.B(60<sup>th</sup>

                  Enemy remarkably quiet during early hours and seemed to be
                  working hard. Accomodation in front line was insufficient and
                  the few remaining hours were devoted to constructing
                  improvised and temporary shelters for men. Some difficulty was
                  experienced in locating Bomb posts and dug-outs in front and
                  support lines, these might be conspicuous by day but had to be
                  found by night. Artillery became active at day light. A
                  bombardment of enemy's salients at C.13.b.0.8 (approx) by our
                  artillery bought heavy enemy retaliation on D.20,D.21 and the
                  WILLOWS causing some damage to dugouts parapets and wire. Work
                  commenced by outgoing unitmin construction of VICARS LANE (new
                  support line) was continued. Enemy showed more activity during
                  early part of night with rifle and M.G, fire but after 10pm
                  this practically ceased. Patrols were sent out on whole of
                  front, nothing of importance was reported.

                  A light gun duel took place during the morning, enemy shelling
                  D.20 and D.21. In the afternoon these points received a few
                  heavy shells. Attitude of enemy at night was vicious from 6 to
                  10pm. he kept up M.G. and rifle fire along whole front. about
                  10.15pm an enemy patrol about 20 strong approached our
                  listening post 150 yards front of B.17. 2<sup>nd</sup> Lt.

                  Front and Support lines intermittantly shelled with schrapnel
                  and H.E. during early hours, durign the day enemy quiet, only
                  a few Whizzbangs fell in Battn. sector. After dusk enemy
                  opened up a bombardment of all ground in rear of trenches with
                  field and Machine Guns and rifle fire, all open expanses of
                  roads, all works and positions and dumps came in for special
                  attention. Later Machine Guns opposite D.20 considerably
                  impeded work at that point. Artilery retailiation had no
                  apparent effect, although suspected points were fixed as
                  patrols reported nothing of importance.<br />Work continued on

                  Enemy quiet on Battn,. front and his artillery confined itself
                  to targets in rear of line. Aircraft active during morning.
                  Usual Machine Gun and rifle fire up to 10pm. Battn. relieved
                  by 11<sup>th</sup> Rifle Brigade, relief carried out quietly
                  and completed at 1.10am. During period 10/14<sup>th</sup> Mar
                  Battn. were in touch with 61<sup>st</sup> Bde. on left flank
                  and 10<sup>th</sup> Kings Royal Rifles on right flank. Salvage
                  parties were sent out nightly to collect abandoned stores,
                  equipment etc. All material collected was returned to Brigade
                  H.Q. A system of signalling to supporting Batteries by means
                  of firing up red very lights from different places in Battn,
                  sector was tried. Lights were fired from 5 points but it seems
                  improbable that they could be seen by observers at Battery
                  position chiefly because they do not rise high enough; also
                  lights fired from N<sup>o.'s</sup> 3 and 4 positions - as
                  viewed from Battn. HQ., seemed to rise from the same place.<br />All
                  rations had to be carried from a dump near Canal Bank to the
                  Line in sandbags, reserve platoons from LA BELLE ALLIANCE were
                  used for this work. It was found impossible to keep fires
                  burning in front line during daylight as any signs of smoke
                  drew hostile artillery fire. Hot meals were therefore, out of
                  the question, and preserved

                  Moved to relieve 11 R.B. in Trenches. Whilst Battalion was
                  marching out of Chateau an incident occure which suggested
                  espionage. The enemy burst about 40 rounds of heavy schrapnel
                  between Chateau and road and of avenue to main road. It may
                  have been a coincidence but the Chateau had never before been
                  shelled at night and schrpnel was obviously intended to catch
                  moving troops as occupants would be inside at night.
                  Fortunately no casualties were caused. Enemy followed
                  Battalion up to Canal Bank with hids fire even shelling tracks
                  across the fields. Bridge 4 and ESSEX FARM were heavily
                  shelled whilst relief was in progress. Relief completed about
                  1.45 am. Enemy activity ceased about 1 am. After relief work
                  consisted filling and stacking sandbags for use on following
                  nights.

                  bombardment on Battn.'s left sector, the WILLOWS and VICARS
