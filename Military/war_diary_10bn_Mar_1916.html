                To assist operations of Vth Corps at ST ELOI, Battn. stood to at
                4am and opened rapid rifle and M.G. fire in conjuction with
                bombardment of enemy lines by covering artillery. Enemny
                immediately responded with Artillery of all calibres and heavy
                M.G and rifle fire. This was kept up until 4.45am when enemy
                fire ceased and situation became normal shortly afterwards.
                During the day enemy was very quiet but watchful. Battalion
                relieved by 12 R.B(60<sup>th</sup> Brigade) at night. Relief

                Helmet drill and rapid fire were carried out. As far as possible

                Enemy remarkably quiet during early hours and seemed to be
                working hard. Accomodation in front line was insufficient and
                the few remaining hours were devoted to constructing improvised
                and temporary shelters for men.Some difficulty was experienced
                in locating Bomb posts and dug-outd in front and support lines,
                these might be conspicuous by day but had to be found by night.
                Artillery became active at day light. A bombardment of enemy's
                salients at C.13.b.0.8 (approx) by our artillery bought heavy
                enemy retaliation on D.20,D.21 and the WILLOWS causing some
                damage to dugouts parapets and wire. Work commenced by outgoing
                unitmin construction of VICARS LANE (new support line) was
                continued. Enemy showed more activity during early part of night
                with rifle and M.G, fire but after 10pm this practically ceased.
                Patrols were sent out on whole of front, nothing of importance
                was reported.

                A light gun duel took place during the morning, enemy shelling
                D.20 and D.21. In the afternoon these points received a few
                heavy shells. Attitude of enemy at night was vicious from 6 to
                10pm. he kept up M.G. and rifle fire along whole front. about
                10.15pm an enemy patrol about 20 strong approached our listening
                post 150 yards front of B.17. 2<sup>nd</sup> Lt. S.W.FORTUNE and
                two bombers went out from B.17 to investigate and appears to
                have encountered enemy sooner than they anticipated, 2 bombs
                were thrown from inside and a bomb simultaneously thrown by
                enemy wounded the 2 men, 2<sup>nd</sup> Lt. FORTUNE appears to
                have been shot point blank and his body carried away. A strong
                patrol went out immediately but were unable to overtake
                enemy.<br />Work was hindered by enemy M.G. fire somewhat, but
                never ceased. work was continued. new instructions received from
                Brigade on, wire, reclaiming, revetting and strengthening
                parapets.

                Front and Support lines intermittantly shelled with schrapnel
                and H.E. during early hours, durign the day enemy quiet, only a
                few Whizzbangs fell in Battn. sector. After dusk enemy opened up
                a bombardment of all ground in rear of trenches with field and
                Machine Guns and rifle fire, all open expanses of roads, all
                works and positions and dumps came in for special attention.
                Later Machine Guns opposite D.20 considerably impeded work at
                that point. Artilery retailiation had no apparent effect,
                although suspected points were fixed as patrols reported nothing
                of importance.<br />Work continued on previous lines in front
                line in new support line wiring continued.

                out nightly to collect abandoned stores, equipment etc. All
                material collected was returned to Brigade H.Q. A system of
                signalling to supporting Batteries by means of firing up red
                very lights from different places in Battn, sector was tried.
                Lights were fired from 5 points but it seems improbable that
                they could be seen by observers at Battery position chiefly
                becaus they do not rise high enough; also lights fired from No's
                3 and 4 positions - as viewed from Battn. HQ., seemed to rise
                from the same place.<br />All rations had to be carried from a
                dump near Canal Bank to the Line in sandbags, reserve platoons
                from LA BELLE ALLIANCE were used for this work. It was found
                impossible to keep fires burning in front line during daylight
                as any signs of smoke drew hostile artillery fire. Hot meals
                were therefore, out of the question, and preserved

                Moved to relieve 11 R.B. in Trenches. Whilst Battalion was marching out of Chateau an incident occure which suggested espionage. The enemy burst about 40 rounds of heavy schrapnel between Chateau and road and of avenue to main road. It may have been a coincidence but the Chateau had never before been shelled at night and schrpnel was obviously intended to catch moving troops as occupants would be inside at night. Fortunately no casualties were caused. Enemy followed Battalion up to Canal Bank with hids fire even shelling tracks across the fields.
