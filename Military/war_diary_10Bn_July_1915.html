              Work was done daily on parapets, dugouts, parados and revetting

              front of parapets. No event of importance happened during this
              period, patrols went out as usual and all information was reported
              to Brigade as before. Whilst on patrol on Sept 7th with Capt
              Felton, 2nd lLt Coates was seen by enemy and fired on about 60 yds
              from enemies line. Lt Coates and Capt Felton were both hit. Felton
              in 3 places, Lt Coats told Felton to go back as he was done for.
              Felton crawled back and reported the matter. 2nd Lt Everard went
              out immediately and found the body, but was forced to return as
              fire was again opened on him. He reported that Mr. Coates was in
              his opinion dead. At dusk an Officers patrol went out to recover
              the body. They reached the spot, but found that the body was
              missing. From marks in the grass they formed the opinion that the
              body had been dragged to the German Trenches. Owing to the slope
              of the ground at this point, which was towards enemy lines it was
              impossible to see the body or spot from our lines. Casualties 1

              ground. On the 22nd the enemy were very quiet and appeared to be
