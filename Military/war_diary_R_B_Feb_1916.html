                firing line one in immediate support and each having the call if
                two platoons from one of the reserve companies. The company in
                the KEEP was brought up as Battalion Reserve.<br />Enemy guns

                Enemy Machine Gun and Rifle fire was very heavy in reply chiefly
                from their front line judging from the amount of fire from their
