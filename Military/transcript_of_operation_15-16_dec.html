          Report on Operations carried out on night 15/16 December 1915<br />
          in accordance with 59th Brigade O.O No. 19 and 10th (S) Bn. Rifle
          Brigade O.C. No. 6.

          By 10.30pm on the night 15th December all the parties emmerated in
          operation Order No.6, 10th (S) Bn. Rifle Brigade, were assembled in
          the trenches close to the newly constructed Sally Port which had been
          prepared in our parpet that evening and a lane out through our wire.
          Signalling communication by wire was established between Raid
          Headquarters and the Artillery also Raid Headquarters and Battalion
          Headquarters. Bridging and scaling ladders had been brought up the
          night before. Axes, electric torches to be fixed to rifles, wire
          gloves, bomb gloves and wire cutters were dealt out where necessary
          and countersign arranged. A French horn for recall was given to Lt.
          Rucker - also a whistle. During the day the machine gun officer had
          laid two guns on the enemy's parapet on the flanks of our objective
          and two on the parapet where it was proposed to cut the wire - these
          later played on the parapet till the wire cutters went out, when they
          were slightly elevated and kept firing at intervals thereby embrassing
          the sentries. The original arrangement with the Artillery was for a
          barrage to be put round the part attacked on receiving the signal
          "Right curtain" from the O.C. Raid; but due to information recieved
          during the afternoon from the 59th Brigade an alternative scheme of a
          more extended barrage was arranged to be applied on the signal
          "Barrage". The night was dark- moon sets at 1.37am, raining slightly
          with slight wind blowing from the enemy.<br />

          At 11.00pm the flank guards, bridge guards with the bridges, wire
          cutters and signal party went out. Bridge guards placed bridges in
          position at 'B' and 'D' and the signallers were established at 'C'.
          The Flank guards proceeded to points 'E' and 'F' at the next ditch
          afterwards moving forward to points 'H' and 'I'. Lieut Rucker with 6
          wire men proceeded to point 'J', which he selected as one point to cut
          the wire and leaving three men there to cut the wire, he proceeded to
          'K' with the other 3. While at 'K' four Germans walking within a few
          yards of him and went into a listening post just inside the German
          wire, as in consequence it was impossible to cut the wire at this
          proposed place, Lieut. Rucker withdrew the 3 wire men a short distance
          leaving them to watch the listening post and returned himself to
          report to O.C. Raid. It was decided to make use of one entry only into
          the enemy's lines.<br />
          About 1.55 am bombs and firing was heard on the left. At 2.00am
          information was sent to Raid Headquarters that the right line had been
          suffciently cut at 'J' and the wire men had returned to 'F' as
          arranged unrolling their tape.<br />O.C. Raid then sent the night
          raiding and blocking parties to point 'C' to wait further orders as it
          was evident that the enemy had been disturbed and it was considered
          advisable to give them time to quiet down.<br />
          As the enemy continued to send up flare and it seemed impossible to
          move any body of men up to the Roman parapet without undue loss it was
          decided not to attack for the present.<br />Leaving the two partiesat
          'C' Lieut Rucker was sent with a party of bombers to attack the
          listening post which he successfully accomplished, throwing in 8 bombs
          from a distance of a few yards, no doubt destroying the inmates, but
          owing to fire being opened on him from the parapet he was unable to
          approach to bring back marks of identification.<br />
          As enemy appeared thoroughly alarmed it was decided on consultation
          with Battalion Headquarters to withdraw all parties behind oue own
          parapet.<br />
          This was successfully accomplished bringing all material with them and
          without any casualties, and the Sally port was closed again before
          daylight.<br />

          <strong>Intention.</strong> The intention of O.C. Raid was to cut the
          wire quietly and effect an entrance without previously alarming the
          enemy.<br />
          If this could not be successfully carried out, no attack would be
          made. In short, a surprise or nothing.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Orders.</strong> Distinct orders were given by the O.O.C. 20th
          Division that such was to be the method of procedure.<br />
          <br /><strong>Object.</strong> The object was not achieved, but the
          enemy's wire was successfully cut without alarming him.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Outstanding Points</strong><br />
          1st. If the wire had been cut earlier the attack could have taken
          place.<br />
          2nd. If there had been no other attack on the same night it could
          still have taken place.<br />
          3rd. The distance between the two lines was perhaps a bit too far, but
          for many reasons it seemed to be the only available spot.<br />
          <strong>Timing</strong><br />
          4th. With regard to timing the attack - it is quite impossible to be
          able to accurately judge even within hours how long a job wire cutting
          under the circumstances will have to tackle, and if too much time is
          allowed the waiting troops become inefficient as fighters through
          cold.<br />
          <strong>Mitigating Circumstances</strong><br />
          Placeing the points of attack beforehand.<br />this was quite
          impossible - <br />
          1st. Owing to our artillery and the enemy continuously changing the
          nature of the wire on their front, and no patrol could get near their
          wire for three days beforehand because the enemy had patrols out, and
          the battalion in the front line was patrolling this front
          thenselves.<br />
          2nd. Spots were picked by O.C. Battalion through glasses but could not
          be recognised by the wire cutters in the dark.<br />
          3rd. The Guards Brigade on our immediate right carried out a small
          raid only the night before.<br />
          4th. Our artillery was continually firing on the German lines for days
          before the attack and this was not conducive to lulling the enemy into
          a false sense of security.<br /><br />
          <strong>Lessons</strong><br />
          Two attacks of this description cannot be carried out at the same time
          close to each other without in the event of being delayed that one
          suffering through the enemy being aroused by the first one.<br /><br />
