                enemy post, could be found. 2 unwounded members of the first
                patrol eventually returned to our lines. 2nd Lt. McCubbin was
                “Missing”. 2nd Lt. J. Farrell joined for duty. Reports received
                that enemy would attach at dawn obtained from prisoners captured
                on the right of our sector. No attack developed, probably owing
                to wet morning. A quiet day. Work done improving our line and
                wiring posts continued. A new MG post made in our line near
                Battalion Headquarters. Some enemy gas shells at night. Reports
                again received late that enemy would attack at dawn on 24th.
                Enemy observed working in VILLIERS BRETONNEUX – WARFUSEE Road,
                fired on by our Lewis guns and rifles from our line. Reported to
                Division by Brigade Major.

                Heavy enemy barrage came down at 3.45am. This continues until
                about 7am, when it became less intense, and chiefly covered
                ground between Reserve line and Battalion Headquarters. Barrage
                included a large proportion of Gas Shells. Continual reports
                received from Os.C. Companies that barrage was not on Front Line
                or Close support Companies during the above hours. During the
                night 23/24th ½ D Company had been moved into close support on
                the right and half on the left by order of G.O.C. 25th Infantry
                Brigade. The morning was very misty and the enemy put down a
                heavy smoke barrage at dawn, making it impossible to see for
                more than 20 yards. About 7am a runner form “A” Company reported
                at Battalion Headquarters that the enemy had got round the right
                flank of the company, and was attacking them and the support
                platoons of “D” Company from flank and rear, and was moving
                towards “C” Company. At 8am “B” Company was ordered to form a
                defensive flank, joining with support platoons of “D” company
                and remains of “C” Company, from “B” Company’s right to reserve
                line. Battalion HQ details moved forward to continue the line
                covering Battn. Headquarters and in touch with 2nd R. Berkshire
                Regt. on the right, N.W. of VILLIERS-BRETONNEUX. 2nd Lt. Gurrier
                and elements of A C & D Coys joined theis line during the
                morning. At 9am enemy Very Lights were seen going up on N.W.
                outskirts of VILLIERS-BRETONNEUX and enemy machine guns opened
                fire on vicinity of Bn. Headquarters. Reserve line and vicinity
                of new line joining with 2nd Royal Berkshire Regt. was shelled
                at intervals all day. B Company on the left was subjected to
                heavy trench Mortar fire at intervals, the enemy advanced
                several times on the right of this company, but each time driven
                off by rifle and machine gun fire. It was afterwards ascertained
                that the enemy, after breaking through SOUTH of VILLIERRS
                BRETONNEUX – WARFUSEE Road, had turned in Northwards, between
                our front line and support lines and also in rear of the latter,
                being unobserved owing to the dense mist and smoke barrage. A &
                C Companies taken unawares in the rear were overwhelmed after a
                sharp fight by superior numbers of the enemy, the whole of the
                two Companies with few exceptions being killed or captured. Very
                little was ascertained as to their exact fate, but it is known
                that one Platoon of D Coy. fought to their last man, as was
                completely wiped out. 2nd Lt. Doyle, was dangerously wounded
                while commanding this Platoon, was found on the night of the
                24/25th during the counter-attack by the Australians. The
                remainder of the day passed without further attacks on our front
                , with the exception of half-hearted

                attempts to turn the right flank of B Company which were
                frustrated by the effective fire , brought to bear on them by
                this company. On the night of 24/25th a counter-attack on
                VILLIERS BRETONNEUX and ground SW of the village, was carried
                out by a Australian Brigade, which surrounded the village,
                establishing itself on the Eastern outskirts as far as the Old
                Hangars on the VILLIERS BRETONNEUX WARFUSEE road, with its right
                flank thrown back. Its left covered the Northern and North
                Western parts of the village, and was extended to the right
                flank of our B Company, where this Company bent back, forming
                our defensive flank. The Australians left at this time was not
                in touch with B Company’s right, but the gap was covered by the
                continuation of our line joining up with the 2nd Royal Berkshire
                Regt. Our lines were shelled at intervals throughout the night.
