                  patrol went out to recover the body. They reached the spot,

                Banquette height above trench floor: ~2 ft (0.6 m) (so a man can
                step up to fire).<br />
                Traverses: placed every 20–50 yards depending on ground and
                threat.<br />
                Barbed-wire belts: tens of yards out in front in belts and
                irregular patterns. (These are representative figures — diaries
                seldom record exact measurements.)
