              Work was done daily on parapets, dugouts, parados and revetting

              front of parapets. No event of importance happened during this
              period, patrols went out as usual and all information was reported
              to Brigade as before. Whilst on patrol on Sept 7th with Capt
              Felton, 2nd lLt Coates was seen by enemy and fired on about 60 yds
              from enemies line. Lt Coates and Capt Felton were both hit. Felton
              in 3 places, Lt Coats told Felton to go back as he was done for.
              Felton crawled back and reported the matter. 2nd Lt Everard went
              out immediately and found the body, but was forced to return as
              fire was again opened on him. He reported that Mr. Coates was in
              his opinion dead. At dusk an Officers patrol went out to recover
              the body. They reached the spot, but found that the body was
              missing. From marks in the grass they formed the opinion that the
              body had been dragged to the German Trenches. Owing to the slope
              of the ground at this point, which was towards enemy lines it was
              impossible to see the body or spot from our lines. Casualties 1

              ground. On the 22nd the enemy were very quiet and appeared to be

              and Fauquissart. Enemy front line on this frontage appeared to be
              strongly held. A few Rifle Grenades and trench motars were fired
              at our lines. Aim was not always accurate and up to the 21st no

              two mines were exploded by us oposite N13.5, beyond sending up a
              large number of flares the enemy did not seem interested. A ditch
              in N13(approx) was investigated by an officers patrol but did not
              appear to be used by enemy and was not wired. A 1-pds which fired
              5 rounds at our parapet on the 20th was located at
              N.19.a.4&frac12;.9. On the 20th 2nd Lt's Thomas Lancelot, Messil
              Mearse and Beauford Remmington Hill were accidentally wounded by a
              bomb exploding, whilst undergoing a course of instruction at
              Bombing School Laventie. On the night of 21/22 enermy appeared to
              have large working party out on wire and parapet, and also
              appeared to be very jovial shouting across to our lines all night.
              Enemy working parties were continued on the 23rd. A few shells
              were fired by enemy between M18.d.Y.6 and N13.a.2.2. and enemy
              were very noisy singing whistling and shouting and talking to our
              sentries. Casualities during week Killed 1 wounded 2 and 2nd Lt's
              Hill and Mearse accidently wounded.
