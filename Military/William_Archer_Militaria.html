          <p>
            <strong>William Albert Archer</strong> served as a Rifleman in the
            <strong>12th (Service) Battalion, King’s Royal Rifle Corps</strong>
            during the First World War. His service number,
            <strong>R/6280</strong>, indicates that he was a wartime volunteer,
            part of the large New Army formations raised in response to the
            outbreak of war.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 12th Battalion landed in France in 1915 and served continuously
            on the Western Front. By 1917 it formed part of
            <strong>60th Brigade in the 20th (Light) Division</strong>, a
            formation composed largely of light infantry and rifle regiments and
            frequently committed to demanding front-line operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the summer of 1917 the battalion was engaged in the
            <strong>Third Battle of Ypres</strong>, one of the most prolonged
            and costly British offensives of the war. Conditions in the Ypres
            Salient were exceptionally severe, with heavy rain, deep mud, and
            constant artillery fire making even routine movement dangerous.
          </p>

          <p>
            On <strong>16 August 1917</strong>, William’s battalion took part in
            the fighting associated with the
            <strong>Battle of Langemarck</strong>, a major phase of the Ypres
            offensive. British units attacked heavily defended German positions
            across waterlogged ground, sustaining significant casualties from
            shellfire, machine-gun fire, and counter-attacks.
          </p>

          <p>
            William Albert Archer was killed on that day. His death occurred
            during a period when the battlefield was densely occupied by British
            divisions, with battalions frequently holding adjacent sectors or
            rotating through the same trench systems. Other rifle regiments,
            including battalions of <strong>The Rifle Brigade</strong>, were
            operating in the same general area at this time.
          </p>

          <p>
            William’s death reflects the experience of many New Army soldiers in
            1917, fighting in appalling conditions for limited gains at immense
            human cost. He was one of countless men whose lives were lost in the
            mud and shell-fire of the Ypres Salient.
