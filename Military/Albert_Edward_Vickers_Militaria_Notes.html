          <!-- This section will be included in the War Diary of teh 10th Battn, July 1915-->
          <p>
            Alberts Military service started in September 1914, when he joined
            the 10<sup>th.</sup> Battalion The Rifle Brigade, in in UK. During
            this period he would have been involved in basic training in advance
            of being posted to France
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            21<sup>st</sup> to 29<sup>th</sup> July 1915 the Battalion was
            posted to France, leaving it's base at Canadian Camp Larkhill, less
            transport, in half Battn, entraining at Jamesbury Station for
            Folkestone in two train loads, then on to Boulogne. disembarked and
            marched to rest camp
          </p>
          <p>
            On 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1917, Albert is recorded as being in
            Hospital in Kent, having been wounded in the chest and Arm. [full
            details not known currently] Albert was awarded the Military Medal
            on 24/04/1918 This Level 3 Gallantry Medal was established during
            the First World War on the 25<sup>th</sup> March 1916 and introduced
            in the London Gazette issue 29525 (back dated to 1914) to personnel
            of the British Army and other services, and personnel of
            Commonwealth countries, below commissioned rank. It was the other
            ranks' equivalent to the Military Cross (M.C.), (which was awarded
            to Commissioned Officers and, rarely, to Warrant Officers, who could
            also be awarded the M.M.) The military decoration was awarded to
            A.E.Vickers for acts of gallantry and devotion to duty under fire or
            for individual or associated acts of bravery which were insufficient
            to merit the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conferment of the medal was announced in the London Gazette and
            A.E.Vickers earned the right to add the letters M.M. to his name.

          <h3>Battles and events concerning Albert Vickers</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Between 20<sup>th</sup> April and 28<sup>th</sup> April 1918, Albert
            was in
            <b>Villiers-Bretonneux.</b>
            The War Diaries for this period provide the details. Where we have
            difficulies, at this point in time, is working out exactly when he
            transfered from the 10<sup>th.</sup> Battalion to the 2<sup
              >nd.</sup
            >
            Currently it has been assumed that this occured in the early part of
            1918, I have nothing at this point in time to counter that
            arguement.
