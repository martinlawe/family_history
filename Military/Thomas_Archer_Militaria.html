          <p>
            <strong>Thomas Archer</strong> served as a private soldier in the
            Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry during the First
            World War. His service number, <strong>9184</strong>, places him
            among the regiment’s regular soldiers, indicating that he enlisted
            before the outbreak of war or in its earliest months.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the start of the conflict, Thomas was associated with the
            <strong>1st Battalion</strong>, a professional unit of the British
            Army that formed part of the original British Expeditionary Force.
            Like many regular infantrymen, he would have undergone rigorous
            training and entered the war as part of a small, highly disciplined
            army that bore the brunt of the fighting in its opening phases.
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point during the war — most likely in late 1915 — Thomas was
            transferred away from the Western Front. Such transfers were common,
            particularly for experienced soldiers, and often went unrecorded in
            later summaries. He was posted to <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>, a
            campaign that, although overshadowed by events in Europe, proved to
            be one of the most challenging and poorly supplied theatres of the
            war.
          </p>

          <p>
            British forces in Mesopotamia suffered from extreme heat, inadequate
            logistics, and serious medical shortages. In early 1916, these
            weaknesses culminated in the disastrous
            <strong>siege and surrender of Kut-al-Amara</strong>, where a large
            British force was forced to capitulate to Ottoman troops. Thousands
            of soldiers were taken prisoner.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thomas was among those captured and became a
            <strong>prisoner of war</strong>. Conditions for British POWs in
            Mesopotamia were severe. Many endured forced marches, chronic
            hunger, disease, and the long-term effects of exhaustion and
            malnutrition. A significant number survived captivity only to die
            later from illnesses contracted during their imprisonment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thomas died on <strong>31 July 1916</strong>, approximately three
            months after the surrender at Kut. His death occurred at
            <strong>Basra</strong>, the main British administrative and medical
            centre in the region. This suggests that he may have been recovered
            from captivity but was already too weakened to survive. He was
            buried there, far from home, one of many men whose deaths resulted
            not from a single battle but from the cumulative hardships of the
            Mesopotamian campaign.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thomas Archer’s story reflects a less-remembered aspect of the First
            World War: a conflict fought not in the trenches of France and
            Belgium, but in the heat and dust of the Middle East, where
            logistical failure and disease claimed lives as surely as enemy
            fire. His death stands as a reminder of the global scale of the war
            and of those whose sacrifices occurred far from the main theatres
            that dominate popular memory.
