<h3>📜 Introduction</h3>
<p> Tracing the Vickers family history brings us face-to-face with a few unanswered questions—unanswered by me, at least—so let’s take a flexible approach as we explore the story. The family originally hails from Goulceby in Lincolnshire, where William Vickers Snr was born in 1785. At some point—likely for work—he and his wife, Anne Dellar, moved south to Windsor. While we don’t know the precise reason, we do know their eldest son, William John, was born there in 1806. </p> <p> By 1812, William and Anne were back in Lincolnshire, where their daughter Maria was born. It’s unclear whether William John stayed in Windsor with relatives or returned north with his parents, but by 1826 he was certainly back in Windsor, marrying Sarah Gibbons. Through Sarah’s lineage, the Vickers family connects to the Brocas line via William D’Oyly—and further back still through the D’Oyly family itself. </p> <p> The Brocas family, as we’ll see in their branch of the tree, were significant landowners in the Windsor area and even served in Parliament. As we follow the D’Oyly line, the story reaches back through the Norman Conquest, into Normandy, and possibly even Scandinavia. </p> <p> While the main Vickers narrative highlights the Brocas and D’Oyly branches, the history runs deeper. Researching records from before 1340 is often a patchy business, but thanks to genealogical archives like FamilySearch.org, we’ve uncovered enough to tell a meaningful story. </p> <p> We’ve already explored the life of Sir Bernard Brocas. At this point, only one record exists for his father, <span class="disabled">Bernard Brocas (born 1266)</span>. With the Brocas chapter complete, we now turn to the D’Oyly family—where the next stage of our journey begins. </p>
<h3>🧬 The D’Oyly Family Line</h3>
<p> In the main storyline, the D’Oyly family gets only a brief mention before attention shifts to the Brocas branch. But this family deserves a closer look. With ties to the English royal household and deep Norman roots, their legacy is both historically significant and richly layered. The lineage below offers a simplified view of the paternal D’Oyly line, tracing the path to William D’Oyly, and eventually to Susanna D’Oyly—the bridge back to the Brocas family. <a href="The Vickers Family History.html">click here for the later Vickers family history</a>. </p>
<h3>🏗️ Robert d’Oyly – Castle Builder and Elder Brother</h3>
<p>
    Before turning to Nigel d’Oyly, it’s worth pausing to mention his elder brother, Robert. He arrived in England with William the Conqueror in 1066 and soon became one of the King’s trusted companions. Robert was made High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and played a key role in strengthening Norman rule.
</p>
<p>
    He was responsible for building <strong>Oxford Castle</strong> and is also believed to have helped oversee the early construction of <strong>Windsor Castle</strong>—both strategically important fortresses for the new Norman administration. Though Robert had no sons, his influence lived on through Nigel, who inherited much of his land and position.
</p>

<h3>🏰 Nigel d’Oyly</h3>
<p> At the foundation of this part of the family tree stands Nigel d’Oyly (also recorded as Nigel de Ouilly), born around 1040 in Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, Calvados, Normandy. Though earlier ancestry exists, Nigel is the earliest well-documented figure in this section., his father was Gilbert D'Ouilly, who was born in France in 1035. He became the 2nd Lord of Hook Norton and served as Constable of Oxford Castle—a prestigious royal appointment in post-Conquest England. </p>
<h3>🛡️ Origins & Family Background</h3>
<ul> <li>Nigel came from Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, near Lisieux in Normandy—a region known for its military households.</li> <li>He was the younger brother of Robert D’Oyly, a trusted companion of William the Conqueror and builder of Oxford and Windsor Castles.</li> <li>Their father, Gilbert de Ouilly, held lordship over their ancestral lands in Normandy.</li> </ul>
<h3>🏯 Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
<ul> <li>After Robert died without heirs, Nigel inherited the barony of Hook Norton in Oxfordshire.</li> <li>He was appointed Constable of Oxford Castle during the reign of King William II.</li> <li>He also held lands at Grandpont, granted to him by Abbot Columbanus—suggesting strong ecclesiastical ties.</li> </ul>
<h3>👪 Marriage & Descendants</h3>
<ul> <li>Nigel married a woman named Agnes. Together they had at least two sons: <ul> <li><strong>Robert D’Oyly the Younger</strong>, who inherited Hook Norton and continued the family’s English legacy.</li> <li><strong>Fulk D’Oyly</strong>, who remains documented in records as late as 1139.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<h3>⏳ Later Life & Legacy</h3>
<ul> <li>Nigel passed away around 1115, likely in or near Hook Norton.</li> <li>He was succeeded by his son Robert as the 3rd Baron of Hook Norton.</li> </ul>
<h3>🕰️ Why He Matters</h3>
<p> Nigel d’Oyly stands as a vital link between Normandy and England—between conquest and continuity. Through him, the D’Oyly name became woven into the political and spiritual fabric of medieval England. His descendants would go on to found Osney Abbey and extend the family’s influence across centuries of English history. </p>
<h3>✅ Summary</h3>
<ul> <li><strong>Born:</strong> c.1040 in Normandy</li> <li><strong>Died:</strong> c.1115 in Oxfordshire</li> <li><strong>Titles:</strong> Lord of Hook Norton, Constable of Oxford Castle</li> <li><strong>Family:</strong> Son of Gilbert de Ouilly; brother to Robert D’Oyly; father of Robert and Fulk</li> <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Pivotal in establishing the D’Oyly line in England</li> </ul>
