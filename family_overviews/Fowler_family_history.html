        The above is the current tree, stretching back to William Munday 1731,
        it is believed that his mother was Sausanna Sirat, but as of October
        2025, we cannot confirm this. William Munday married Elizabeth Allen in
        1755, their son Wiliam Munday 1758 married Susanna Cook in 1778, and
        their daughter Hannah Munday 1787 married William Fowler 1805. Their son
        Joseph Fowler 1808 married Eliza Sinfield in 1830 and their Edward
        Fowler 1843 married Emma Spiers in 1848.

      <p>
        At this point we start to get close to known relatives, So, Edward and
        Emma had a daughter Matilda, born in 1868, The story from this point is
        somewhat complex, so I will not being going into that here, at this
        point in time. Matilda had two daughters Minnie and Emily, in 1888 and
        1890 respectivley, she then Married Thomas Archer, and had a number of
        children with him, Thomas adopted both earlier daughters.
