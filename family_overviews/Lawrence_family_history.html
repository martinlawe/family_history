        This family story begins with
        <a href="../people/John_Laurence.html">John Laurence</a>, who was born
        in the mid-1700s—possibly in St Albans, although Watford is also closely
        associated with the family's early roots. John married Elizabeth
        (surname unknown), and together they had a son,
        <a href="../people/William_Laurence.html">William Laurence</a>, born in
        1790.
      </p>
      <p>
        William married Charlotte Knowles in 1806, and their son
        <a href="../people/Thomas_Laurence.html">Thomas Laurence</a> was born in
        Watford in 1817. In 1844, Thomas married
        <a href="../people/Myra_Emmons.html">Myra Emmons</a>, who was born in
        Whatfield, Suffolk. Her father,
        <a href="../people/Simon_Emmons.html">Simon Emmons</a>, was born in
        1792.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="../commentary/suffolk_history_1830_to_1839.html"
          >In the early 1800s</a
        >, life in rural England was harsh. Work was scarce, wages were low, and
        poor harvests made even basic sustenance difficult. In 1838, Simon
        Emmons was caught stealing seed and grain from a local storehouse—likely
        an act of desperation. At the time, Britain regularly transported
        convicted criminals to penal colonies. Simon was sentenced to seven
        years' transportation to Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), where
        he died two years later in 1840.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following her father’s conviction and death, Myra appears to have moved
        to Watford—possibly to live with extended family or to seek work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 1856,
        <a href="../people/Walter_Lawrence.html">Walter Lawrence</a> was born to
        Thomas and Myra. He was the sixth of ten children, with three older
        brothers and five younger sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1879, Walter—then working as a painter and decorator—married
        <a href="../people/Ellen_Evans.html">Ellen Evans</a> in Watford. They
        had two children:
        <a href="../people/Mary_Ann_Florence_Lawrence.html">Mary</a> (b.1882)
        and
        <a href="../people/Gertrude_Lillian_Lawrence.html">Gertrude</a>
        (b.1883).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1883, the family emigrated to America, settling in Woodtick, a rural
        area in Hartford County, Connecticut. During this time, many British
        skilled workers emigrated to the United States in search of better
        prospects. The American economy was expanding, and tradesmen like Walter
        often found more reliable employment across the Atlantic. While in the
        U.S.,
        <a href="../people/Walter_S._Lawrence.html">Walter Lawrence Jr.</a> was
        born in 1888.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to census records, by 1910 Gertrude had returned to live with
        her parents in Connecticut, bringing her son
        <a href="../people/Kenneth_G._Benoit.html">Kenneth</a> with her. Around
        this time, Walter Sr. made the unexpected decision to return to
        England—alone. The reasons for his return remain unclear, but it seems
        to have been a permanent separation from his first family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Circa 1916, back in Watford, Walter met and eventually
        <strong>married</strong>
        <a href="../people/Emily_Archer.html">Emily Archer</a>. His wife and
        children remained in America, this was a case of bigamy—a criminal
        offence at the time. Socially and legally, this would have carried
        serious implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walter and Emily had three children together:
        <a href="../people/Evelyn_Lawrence.html">Evelyn</a> (b.1919),
        <a href="../people/Margaret_Lawrence.html">Margaret</a> (b.1922), and
        <a href="../people/Leslie_Lawrence.html">Leslie</a> (b.1925). During
        Emily’s pregnancy with Leslie, she discovered Walter’s previous marriage
        and family in America. According to family accounts, the revelation
        caused a major confrontation, with reports of raised voices, objects
        thrown, and even the police being informed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emily left Walter shortly afterwards and returned to Windsor to live
        with her mother. Evelyn later recalled travelling into Windsor Central
        Station in the spring of 1925 and looking out at fields of buttercups on
        Bath Island. The family lived briefly in Kepple Row before settling, for
        a short period, at No. 4 Alma Cottages, where Leslie was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1926, Walter returned to the United States, this time permanently. He
        rejoined his original family and appears in the 1930 U.S. Census living
        once again with Ellen and Walter Jr.
