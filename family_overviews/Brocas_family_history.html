      <p>
        Before we get into the details for this family history, I need to
        explain what you are seeing in the trees above. these cover the Vickers
        family line through Sarah Gibbons back to Sir Bernard Brocas, the name
        at the bottom of each tree, connects directly to the name at the top of
        the next tree, running left to right. This a part of the Vickers family
        history, The links at the top of the page, will take you to the other
        elements.
      </p>
      <br /><!--This section needs to be rewritten - currently it includes both the Brocas family and the D'Oyly family, these need to be split. Also there needs to be a new page dealing solely with the D'Oyly family. -->
      <p>
        The Brocas family, as we’ll see in their branch of the tree, were
        significant landowners in the Windsor area and even served in
        Parliament.
      </p>
      <!--<p>
        While the main Vickers narrative highlights the Brocas and D’Oyly
        branches, the history runs deeper. Researching records from before 1340
        is often a patchy business, but thanks to genealogical archives like
        FamilySearch.org, we’ve uncovered enough to tell a meaningful story.
      </p>  -->
      <p>
        Let's start with Sir Bernard Brocas (c. 1330–1395) he was a notable
        English knight, military commander, and courtier during the reigns of
        Edward III and Richard II.He is best remembered for his close
        association with Edward, the
        <a href="../commentary/Black_Prince.html">Black Prince</a>, and his
        distinguished service in the Hundred Years' War.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Life and Career of Sir Bernard Brocas</h3>
      <br />

      <p>
        Born around 1330 in Clewer, Berkshire, Bernard was the third son of Sir
        John Brocas, Master of the King's Horse to Edward III. The Brocas family
        hailed from Gascony, France, and had a long history of service to the
        English crown.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Bernard's military career was marked by participation in several key
        battles of the Hundred Years' War, including Crécy (1346), Poitiers
        (1356), and Nájera (1367). He was a close companion of the Black Prince
        and served as Constable of Aquitaine during the English administration
        of the region.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In England, Bernard held several important positions. He was appointed
        <a href="../Commentary/Chamberlain.html">Chamberlain</a> to Queen Anne
        of Bohemia, wife of Richard II, and served as High Sheriff of Wiltshire
        in 1382. He also represented Hampshire in Parliament multiple times
        between 1367 and 1395.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Bernard's personal life included three marriages:</h4>
      <br />
      <il>
        1. <em>Agnes Vavasour</em> (married c. 1354): This marriage ended in
        divorce. 2. <em>Mary des Roches</em> (married 1361): Through this
        union, Bernard acquired significant estates, including Roche Court in
        Hampshire, and the hereditary office of Master of the Royal Buckhounds.
        3. <em>Katherine Plaunk</em> (married 1382): The widow of Sir Hugh
        Tyrrell.
      </il>
      <p>
        Bernard died on 20 September 1395 and was buried in St. Edmund's Chapel
        in Westminster Abbey. His tomb features an effigy in full plate armour,
        and the inscription reads:<br />

        "Here lies Bernard Brocas, soldier, one-time Chamberlain to Queen Anne
        of England: upon whose soul may God look graciously. Amen.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        We’ve already explored the life of Sir Bernard Brocas. At this point,
        only one record exists for his father, Bernard Brocas (born 1266).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Brocas family played significant roles as landowners, knights, and
        royal officials. A central figure is
        <a href="Bernard_Brocas.html">Sir Bernard Brocas</a>, who served as a
        trusted companion to the
        <a href="Black_Prince.html">Black Prince</a> during the Hundred Years’
        War. His service earned the family lands and a notable standing in the
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Bernard’s son,
        <a href="Bernard_Brocas_the_Younger.html">Bernard the Younger</a>, met a
        tragic fate when he was executed for his involvement in the Epiphany
        Rising—an unsuccessful rebellion against King Henry IV. Despite this
        setback, the Brocas family’s influence persisted, strengthened through
        marriages such as that of Elizabeth Brocas to Richard Moore of
        Burghfield, Berkshire.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Marriage and Family Connections</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Elizabeth Brocas (c.1428–?) married into the Moore family, linking the
        Brocas lineage to new estates and local prominence. Their children,
        including Isabella Moore and Richard Moore (who married Catherine
        Arlott), continued the family’s presence in Berkshire and beyond.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Estates and Geography</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Brocas family held several important estates that underscore their
        status and regional influence:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clewer (Windsor)</strong>: The family’s principal seat,
          situating them close to the royal court.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beaurepaire Manor</strong>: Located in Hampshire, this estate
          highlights the Brocas reach beyond Windsor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Greenlands Manor, Hambleden</strong>: While primarily linked
          with the D’Oyly family, it is part of the interconnected network of
          estates associated with the broader family history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookham</strong>: Nearby Windsor, this area appears frequently
          in parish records connected to these families.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Historical Notes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both the Brocas and D’Oyly families were part of England’s medieval
        nobility and military elite. Their lives intertwined with royal courts
        and complex landholdings, and their descendants often married into the
        local gentry. Over generations, it was not uncommon for noble lines to
        blend into the yeoman or labouring classes, yet their heritage remained
        a proud part of the family story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Reflections on Noble Descent</h3>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Noble ancestry can sometimes seem distant when later generations lead
          more modest lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Records show that while some descendants worked as agricultural
          labourers, their roots connect them to figures of considerable
          historical importance.
        </li>
