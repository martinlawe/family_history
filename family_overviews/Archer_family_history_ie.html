      <h1>Archer Family History</h1>
      <p>
        The Archer surname has deep historical roots in Kilkenny, and the family
        is listed among the ten key “civic families” who shaped the city's
        governance from the medieval period onward. While a complete family line
        has not yet been established, the historical presence of the Archers in
        Thomastown and Kilkenny offers important context.
      </p>
      <h2>🏛️ The Archer Family in Medieval and Early Modern Kilkenny</h2>
      <p>
        The Archers were prominent in local affairs well before the 17th
        century. Records indicate their participation in municipal governance
        and mayoral duties in Kilkenny. As one of the “Ten Civic Families,” they
        held long standing political and social influence in the city and
        region.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Archer family is documented in civic roles from the late medieval
          period.
        </li>
        <li>
          They were involved in governance and helped shape the development of
          Kilkenny’s municipal institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          A significant offshoot of the family emerged in the late 1600s,
          centred on Mount John (near Wicklow), with Patrick Archer
          (c.1615–1686) being a key figure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Though the Wicklow and Kilkenny lines may have diverged, they appear
          to share a common origin.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>🏘️ The Archer Name in the 20th Century</h2>
      <p>
        While the Archer family appears less frequently in 20th-century indexes
        for Thomastown, the name still carries local historical weight. Several
        reminders of their legacy remain in Kilkenny, most notably in
        architecture and civic heritage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Archer family is remembered as one of Kilkenny’s “Ten Civic
          Families,” a legacy still recognized today.
        </li>
        <li>
          One prominent example is the <strong>Hole in the Wall</strong>, a
          16th-century tavern in Kilkenny’s High Street originally built by the
          Archers. It remains a notable landmark.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some descendants of the Archer line may still reside in Thomastown or
          elsewhere in County Kilkenny.
        </li>
        <li>
          How Our Lawless line fits in with the above, we do not know,
          currently.
