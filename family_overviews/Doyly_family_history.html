      <h3>The D’Oyly Family Line</h3>
      <p>
        In the main storyline, the D’Oyly family gets only a brief mention
        before attention shifts to the Brocas branch. But this family deserves a
        closer look. With ties to the English royal household and deep Norman
        roots, their legacy is both historically significant and richly layered.
        The lineage below offers a simplified view of the paternal D’Oyly line,
        tracing the path to William D’Oyly, and eventually to Susanna D’Oyly—the
        bridge back to the Brocas family.
      </p>
      <h3>Robert d’Oyly Castle Builder and Elder Brother</h3>
      <p>
        Before turning to Nigel d’Oyly, it’s worth pausing to mention his elder
        brother, Robert. He arrived in England with William the Conqueror in
        1066 and soon became one of the King’s trusted companions. Robert was
        made High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and played a key role in strengthening
        Norman rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was responsible for building <strong>Oxford Castle</strong> and is
        also believed to have helped oversee the early construction of
        <strong>Windsor Castle</strong>—both strategically important fortresses
        for the new Norman administration. Though Robert had no sons, his
        influence lived on through Nigel, who inherited much of his land and
        position.
      </p>

      <h3>Nigel d’Oyly</h3>
      <p>
        At the foundation of this part of the family tree stands Nigel d’Oyly
        (also recorded as Nigel de Ouilly), born around 1040 in
        Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, Calvados, Normandy. Though earlier ancestry exists,
        Nigel is the earliest well-documented figure in this section., his
        father was Gilbert D'Ouilly, who was born in France in 1035. He became
        the 2nd Lord of Hook Norton and served as Constable of Oxford Castle—a
        prestigious royal appointment in post-Conquest England.
      </p>
      <h3>Origins & Family Background</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nigel came from Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, near Lisieux in Normandy—a region
          known for its military households.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was the younger brother of Robert D’Oyly, a trusted companion of
          William the Conqueror and builder of Oxford and Windsor Castles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Their father, Gilbert de Ouilly, held lordship over their ancestral
          lands in Normandy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After Robert died without heirs, Nigel inherited the barony of Hook
          Norton in Oxfordshire.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was appointed Constable of Oxford Castle during the reign of King
          William II.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also held lands at Grandpont, granted to him by Abbot
          Columbanus—suggesting strong ecclesiastical ties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Marriage & Descendants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nigel married a woman named Agnes. Together they had at least two
          sons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Robert D’Oyly the Younger</strong>, who inherited Hook
              Norton and continued the family’s English legacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fulk D’Oyly</strong>, who remains documented in records as
              late as 1139.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Later Life & Legacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nigel passed away around 1115, likely in or near Hook Norton.</li>
        <li>
          He was succeeded by his son Robert as the 3rd Baron of Hook Norton.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why He Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Nigel d’Oyly stands as a vital link between Normandy and England—between
        conquest and continuity. Through him, the D’Oyly name became woven into
        the political and spiritual fabric of medieval England. His descendants
        would go on to found Osney Abbey and extend the family’s influence
        across centuries of English history.
      </p>
