      <h3>📜 Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Tracing the Vickers family history brings us face-to-face with a few
        unanswered questions—unanswered by me, at least—so let’s take a flexible
        approach as we explore the story. The family originally hails from
        Goulceby in Lincolnshire, where William Vickers Snr was born in 1785. At
        some point—likely for work—he and his wife, Anne Dellar, moved south to
        Windsor. While we don’t know the precise reason, we do know their eldest
        son, William John, was born there in 1806.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1812, William and Anne were back in Lincolnshire, where their
        daughter Maria was born. It’s unclear whether William John stayed in
        Windsor with relatives or returned north with his parents, but by 1826
        he was certainly back in Windsor, marrying Sarah Gibbons. Through
        Sarah’s lineage, the Vickers family connects to the Brocas line via
        William D’Oyly—and further back still through the D’Oyly family itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Brocas family, as we’ll see in their branch of the tree, were
        significant landowners in the Windsor area and even served in
        Parliament. As we follow the D’Oyly line, the story reaches back through
        the Norman Conquest, into Normandy, and possibly even Scandinavia.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the main Vickers narrative highlights the Brocas and D’Oyly
        branches, the history runs deeper. Researching records from before 1340
        is often a patchy business, but thanks to genealogical archives like
        FamilySearch.org, we’ve uncovered enough to tell a meaningful story.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve already explored the life of Sir Bernard Brocas. At this point,
        only one record exists for his father,
        <span class="disabled">Bernard Brocas (born 1266)</span>. With the
        Brocas chapter complete, we now turn to the D’Oyly family—where the next
        stage of our journey begins.
      </p>
      <h3>🧬 The D’Oyly Family Line</h3>
      <p>
        In the main storyline, the D’Oyly family gets only a brief mention
        before attention shifts to the Brocas branch. But this family deserves a
        closer look. With ties to the English royal household and deep Norman
        roots, their legacy is both historically significant and richly layered.
        The lineage below offers a simplified view of the paternal D’Oyly line,
        tracing the path to William D’Oyly, and eventually to Susanna D’Oyly—the
        bridge back to the Brocas family.

      <h3>🏗️ Robert d’Oyly – Castle Builder and Elder Brother</h3>
      <p>
        Before turning to Nigel d’Oyly, it’s worth pausing to mention his elder
        brother, Robert. He arrived in England with William the Conqueror in
        1066 and soon became one of the King’s trusted companions. Robert was
        made High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and played a key role in strengthening
        Norman rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was responsible for building <strong>Oxford Castle</strong> and is
        also believed to have helped oversee the early construction of
        <strong>Windsor Castle</strong>—both strategically important fortresses
        for the new Norman administration. Though Robert had no sons, his
        influence lived on through Nigel, who inherited much of his land and
        position.
      </p>

      <h3>🏰 Nigel d’Oyly</h3>
      <p>
        At the foundation of this part of the family tree stands Nigel d’Oyly
        (also recorded as Nigel de Ouilly), born around 1040 in
        Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, Calvados, Normandy. Though earlier ancestry exists,
        Nigel is the earliest well-documented figure in this section., his
        father was Gilbert D'Ouilly, who was born in France in 1035. He became
        the 2nd Lord of Hook Norton and served as Constable of Oxford Castle—a
        prestigious royal appointment in post-Conquest England.
      </p>
      <h3>🛡️ Origins & Family Background</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nigel came from Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, near Lisieux in Normandy—a region
          known for its military households.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was the younger brother of Robert D’Oyly, a trusted companion of
          William the Conqueror and builder of Oxford and Windsor Castles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Their father, Gilbert de Ouilly, held lordship over their ancestral
          lands in Normandy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>🏯 Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After Robert died without heirs, Nigel inherited the barony of Hook
          Norton in Oxfordshire.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was appointed Constable of Oxford Castle during the reign of King
          William II.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also held lands at Grandpont, granted to him by Abbot
          Columbanus—suggesting strong ecclesiastical ties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>👪 Marriage & Descendants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nigel married a woman named Agnes. Together they had at least two
          sons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Robert D’Oyly the Younger</strong>, who inherited Hook
              Norton and continued the family’s English legacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fulk D’Oyly</strong>, who remains documented in records as
              late as 1139.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>⏳ Later Life & Legacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nigel passed away around 1115, likely in or near Hook Norton.</li>
        <li>
          He was succeeded by his son Robert as the 3rd Baron of Hook Norton.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>🕰️ Why He Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Nigel d’Oyly stands as a vital link between Normandy and England—between
        conquest and continuity. Through him, the D’Oyly name became woven into
        the political and spiritual fabric of medieval England. His descendants
        would go on to found Osney Abbey and extend the family’s influence
        across centuries of English history.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Now we turns our attention to the Brocas lineage—an influential family
        rooted deeply in the Windsor area and medieval English history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Brocas family played significant roles as landowners, knights, and
        royal officials. A central figure is
        <a href="Bernard_Brocas.html">Sir Bernard Brocas</a>, who served as a
        trusted companion to the
        <a href="Black_Prince.html">Black Prince</a> during the Hundred Years’
        War. His service earned the family lands and a notable standing in the
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Bernard’s son,
        <a href="Bernard_Brocas_the_Younger.html">Bernard the Younger</a>, met a
        tragic fate when he was executed for his involvement in the Epiphany
        Rising—an unsuccessful rebellion against King Henry IV. Despite this
        setback, the Brocas family’s influence persisted, strengthened through
        marriages such as that of Elizabeth Brocas to Richard Moore of
        Burghfield, Berkshire.
      </p>
      <h3>💒 Marriage and Family Connections</h3>
      <p>
        Elizabeth Brocas (c.1428–?) married into the Moore family, linking the
        Brocas lineage to new estates and local prominence. Their children,
        including Isabella Moore and Richard Moore (who married Catherine
        Arlott), continued the family’s presence in Berkshire and beyond.
      </p>
      <h2>📍 Estates and Geography</h2>
      <p>
        The Brocas family held several important estates that underscore their
        status and regional influence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clewer (Windsor)</strong>: The family’s principal seat,
          situating them close to the royal court.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beaurepaire Manor</strong>: Located in Hampshire, this estate
          highlights the Brocas reach beyond Windsor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Greenlands Manor, Hambleden</strong>: While primarily linked
          with the D’Oyly family, it is part of the interconnected network of
          estates associated with the broader family history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookham</strong>: Nearby Windsor, this area appears frequently
          in parish records connected to these families.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>📜 Historical Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Both the Brocas and D’Oyly families were part of England’s medieval
        nobility and military elite. Their lives intertwined with royal courts
        and complex landholdings, and their descendants often married into the
        local gentry. Over generations, it was not uncommon for noble lines to
        blend into the yeoman or laboring classes, yet their heritage remained a
        proud part of the family story.
      </p>
      <h3>💡 Reflections on Noble Descent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Noble ancestry can sometimes seem distant when later generations lead
          more modest lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Records show that while some descendants worked as agricultural
          laborers, their roots connect them to figures of considerable
          historical importance.
        </li>
