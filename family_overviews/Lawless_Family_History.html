        <h1>Lawless Family History</h1>

        <p>
          The Lawless family‚Äôs presence in County Kilkenny stretches back many
          centuries, with the surname appearing in local records as early as the
          14th century. While we can‚Äôt yet confirm a direct link between the
          modern family line and these early figures, the Lawless name has long
          been woven into the history of Thomastown and its surrounding
          parishes.
        </p>

        <h2>‚öñÔ∏è A Historical Footprint in Kilkenny</h2>
        <p>
          The Lawless surname (also recorded historically as ‚ÄúLaghles‚Äù) is of
          Anglo-Norman origin, most commonly found in Leinster and Munster. In
          Kilkenny, the Lawless family was one of the ten key civic families
          during the medieval period, with strong local influence in the town
          and its administration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the more notable early figures associated with the Lawless name
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walter Lawless</strong> ‚Äì Mayor of Kilkenny in 1621.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Richard Lawless</strong> ‚Äì Said to have taken part in the
            1641 Confederate Wars.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thomas Lawless</strong> ‚Äì A soldier serving in the army of
            King James II.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Following the upheaval of the Glorious Revolution, some Lawless family
          members went into exile, while others remained in Ireland. By the 19th
          century, the name appears consistently in land and tenancy records.
          Griffith‚Äôs Valuation (1850s) lists several Lawless households in
          Thomastown, including John and Michael Lawless in Chapel Lane and
          Grennan.
        </p>

        <h2>üï∞Ô∏è Into the 20th Century</h2>
        <p>
          The Lawless name continues into the early 20th century, appearing in
          local service and military records. Among those recorded in the First
          World War Roll of Honour are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Patrick Lawless</strong> ‚Äì From Conahy, died 18 July 1916 in
            France.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Michael Lawless</strong> ‚Äì From Kilkenny, died 15 September
            1916 in France.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At the same time, the town of Thomastown was still shaped by
          19th-century institutions such as the Poor Law Union and the local
          courthouse, both of which remained active well into the early 1900s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lawless family is still being researched, so this page will
          inevitably be updated at some point.
