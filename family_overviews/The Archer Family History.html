        <h1>Archer Family History</h1>
        <p>
          The Archer surname has deep historical roots in Kilkenny, and the
          family is listed among the ten key “civic families” who shaped the
          city's governance from the medieval period onward. While a complete
          family line has not yet been established, the historical presence of
          the Archers in Thomastown and Kilkenny offers important context.
        </p>
        <h2>🏛️ The Archer Family in Medieval and Early Modern Kilkenny</h2>
        <p>
          The Archers were prominent in local affairs well before the 17th
          century. Records indicate their participation in municipal governance
          and mayoral duties in Kilkenny. As one of the “Ten Civic Families,”
          they held long standing political and social influence in the city and
          region.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Archer family is documented in civic roles from the late
            medieval period.
          </li>
          <li>
            They were involved in governance and helped shape the development of
            Kilkenny’s municipal institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            A significant offshoot of the family emerged in the late 1600s,
            centred on Mount John (near Wicklow), with Patrick Archer
            (c.1615–1686) being a key figure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though the Wicklow and Kilkenny lines may have diverged, they appear
            to share a common origin.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>🏘️ The Archer Name in the 20th Century</h2>
        <p>
          While the Archer family appears less frequently in 20th-century
          indexes for Thomastown, the name still carries local historical
          weight. Several reminders of their legacy remain in Kilkenny, most
          notably in architecture and civic heritage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Archer family is remembered as one of Kilkenny’s “Ten Civic
            Families,” a legacy still recognized today.
          </li>
          <li>
            One prominent example is the <strong>Hole in the Wall</strong>, a
            16th-century tavern in Kilkenny’s High Street originally built by
            the Archers. It remains a notable landmark.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some descendants of the Archer line may still reside in Thomastown
            or elsewhere in County Kilkenny.
          </li>
          <li>
            How Our Lawless line fits in with the above, we do not know,
            currently.
