        <h3>📜 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Tracing the Vickers family history brings us face-to-face with a few
          unanswered questions—unanswered by me, at least—so let’s take a
          flexible approach as we explore the story. The family originally hails
          from Goulceby in Lincolnshire, where William Vickers Snr was born in
          1785. At some point—likely for work—he and his wife, Anne Dellar,
          moved south to Windsor. While we don’t know the precise reason, we do
          know their eldest son, William John, was born there in 1806.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1812, William and Anne were back in Lincolnshire, where their
          daughter Maria was born. It’s unclear whether William John stayed in
          Windsor with relatives or returned north with his parents, but by 1826
          he was certainly back in Windsor, marrying Sarah Gibbons. Through
          Sarah’s lineage, the Vickers family connects to the Brocas line via
          William D’Oyly—and further back still through the D’Oyly family
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Brocas family, as we’ll see in their branch of the tree, were
          significant landowners in the Windsor area and even served in
          Parliament. As we follow the D’Oyly line, the story reaches back
          through the Norman Conquest, into Normandy, and possibly even
          Scandinavia.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the main Vickers narrative highlights the Brocas and D’Oyly
          branches, the history runs deeper. Researching records from before
          1340 is often a patchy business, but thanks to genealogical archives
          like FamilySearch.org, we’ve uncovered enough to tell a meaningful
          story.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve already explored the life of Sir Bernard Brocas. At this point,
          only one record exists for his father,
          <span class="disabled">Bernard Brocas (born 1266)</span>. With the
          Brocas chapter complete, we now turn to the D’Oyly family—where the
          next stage of our journey begins.
        </p>
        <h3>🧬 The D’Oyly Family Line</h3>
        <p>
          In the main storyline, the D’Oyly family gets only a brief mention
          before attention shifts to the Brocas branch. But this family deserves
          a closer look. With ties to the English royal household and deep
          Norman roots, their legacy is both historically significant and richly
          layered. The lineage below offers a simplified view of the paternal
          D’Oyly line, tracing the path to William D’Oyly, and eventually to
          Susanna D’Oyly—the bridge back to the Brocas family.
        </p>
        <h3>🏗️ Robert d’Oyly – Castle Builder and Elder Brother</h3>
        <p>
          Before turning to Nigel d’Oyly, it’s worth pausing to mention his
          elder brother, Robert. He arrived in England with William the
          Conqueror in 1066 and soon became one of the King’s trusted
          companions. Robert was made High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and played a
          key role in strengthening Norman rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was responsible for building <strong>Oxford Castle</strong> and is
          also believed to have helped oversee the early construction of
          <strong>Windsor Castle</strong>—both strategically important
          fortresses for the new Norman administration. Though Robert had no
          sons, his influence lived on through Nigel, who inherited much of his
          land and position.
        </p>

        <h3>🏰 Nigel d’Oyly</h3>
        <p>
          At the foundation of this part of the family tree stands Nigel d’Oyly
          (also recorded as Nigel de Ouilly), born around 1040 in
          Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, Calvados, Normandy. Though earlier ancestry exists,
          Nigel is the earliest well-documented figure in this section., his
          father was Gilbert D'Ouilly, who was born in France in 1035. He became
          the 2nd Lord of Hook Norton and served as Constable of Oxford Castle—a
          prestigious royal appointment in post-Conquest England.
        </p>
        <h3>🛡️ Origins & Family Background</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nigel came from Ouilly‑le‑Vicomte, near Lisieux in Normandy—a region
            known for its military households.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was the younger brother of Robert D’Oyly, a trusted companion of
            William the Conqueror and builder of Oxford and Windsor Castles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Their father, Gilbert de Ouilly, held lordship over their ancestral
            lands in Normandy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🏯 Roles & Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After Robert died without heirs, Nigel inherited the barony of Hook
            Norton in Oxfordshire.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was appointed Constable of Oxford Castle during the reign of King
            William II.
          </li>
          <li>
            He also held lands at Grandpont, granted to him by Abbot
            Columbanus—suggesting strong ecclesiastical ties.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>👪 Marriage & Descendants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nigel married a woman named Agnes. Together they had at least two
            sons:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Robert D’Oyly the Younger</strong>, who inherited Hook
                Norton and continued the family’s English legacy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fulk D’Oyly</strong>, who remains documented in records
                as late as 1139.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>⏳ Later Life & Legacy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Nigel passed away around 1115, likely in or near Hook Norton.</li>
          <li>
            He was succeeded by his son Robert as the 3rd Baron of Hook Norton.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🕰️ Why He Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Nigel d’Oyly stands as a vital link between Normandy and
          England—between conquest and continuity. Through him, the D’Oyly name
          became woven into the political and spiritual fabric of medieval
          England. His descendants would go on to found Osney Abbey and extend
          the family’s influence across centuries of English history.
        </p>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Now we turns our attention to the Brocas lineage—an influential family
          rooted deeply in the Windsor area and medieval English history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Brocas family played significant roles as landowners, knights, and
          royal officials. A central figure is
          <a href="Bernard_Brocas.html">Sir Bernard Brocas</a>, who served as a
          trusted companion to the
          <a href="Black_Prince.html">Black Prince</a> during the Hundred Years’
          War. His service earned the family lands and a notable standing in the
          region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir Bernard’s son,
          <a href="Bernard_Brocas_the_Younger.html">Bernard the Younger</a>, met
          a tragic fate when he was executed for his involvement in the Epiphany
          Rising—an unsuccessful rebellion against King Henry IV. Despite this
          setback, the Brocas family’s influence persisted, strengthened through
          marriages such as that of Elizabeth Brocas to Richard Moore of
          Burghfield, Berkshire.
        </p>
        <h3>💒 Marriage and Family Connections</h3>
        <p>
          Elizabeth Brocas (c.1428–?) married into the Moore family, linking the
          Brocas lineage to new estates and local prominence. Their children,
          including Isabella Moore and Richard Moore (who married Catherine
          Arlott), continued the family’s presence in Berkshire and beyond.
        </p>
        <h2>📍 Estates and Geography</h2>
        <p>
          The Brocas family held several important estates that underscore their
          status and regional influence:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Clewer (Windsor)</strong>: The family’s principal seat,
            situating them close to the royal court.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beaurepaire Manor</strong>: Located in Hampshire, this
            estate highlights the Brocas reach beyond Windsor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Greenlands Manor, Hambleden</strong>: While primarily linked
            with the D’Oyly family, it is part of the interconnected network of
            estates associated with the broader family history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookham</strong>: Nearby Windsor, this area appears
            frequently in parish records connected to these families.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>📜 Historical Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Both the Brocas and D’Oyly families were part of England’s medieval
          nobility and military elite. Their lives intertwined with royal courts
          and complex landholdings, and their descendants often married into the
          local gentry. Over generations, it was not uncommon for noble lines to
          blend into the yeoman or laboring classes, yet their heritage remained
          a proud part of the family story.
        </p>
        <h3>💡 Reflections on Noble Descent</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Noble ancestry can sometimes seem distant when later generations
            lead more modest lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Records show that while some descendants worked as agricultural
            laborers, their roots connect them to figures of considerable
            historical importance.
