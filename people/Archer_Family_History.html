  <h1>Archer Family History</h1>

  <p>
    The Archer surname has deep historical roots in Kilkenny, and the family is listed among the ten key “civic families” who shaped the city's governance 
    from the medieval period onward. While a complete family line has not yet been established, the historical presence of the Archers in Thomastown and 
    Kilkenny offers important context.
  </p>

  <h2>🏛️ The Archer Family in Medieval and Early Modern Kilkenny</h2>
  <p>
    The Archers were prominent in local affairs well before the 17th century. Records indicate their participation in municipal governance and mayoral duties 
    in Kilkenny. As one of the “Ten Civic Families,” they held longstanding political and social influence in the city and region.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Archer family is documented in civic roles from the late medieval period.</li>
    <li>They were involved in governance and helped shape the development of Kilkenny’s municipal institutions.</li>
    <li>A significant offshoot of the family emerged in the late 1600s, centred on Mount John (near Wicklow), with Patrick Archer (c.1615–1686) being a key figure.</li>
    <li>Though the Wicklow and Kilkenny lines may have diverged, they appear to share a common origin.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏘️ The Archer Name in the 20th Century</h2>
  <p>
    While the Archer family appears less frequently in 20th-century indexes for Thomastown, the name still carries local historical weight. 
    Several reminders of their legacy remain in Kilkenny, most notably in architecture and civic heritage.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Archer family is remembered as one of Kilkenny’s “Ten Civic Families,” a legacy still recognized today.</li>
    <li>One prominent example is the <strong>Hole in the Wall</strong>, a 16th-century tavern in Kilkenny’s High Street originally built by the Archers. It remains a notable landmark.</li>
    <li>Some descendants of the Archer line may still reside in Thomastown or elsewhere in County Kilkenny.</li>
  </ul>
