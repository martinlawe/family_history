          <h2>Historical Context</h2>
          <p>
            Evelyn was born on 3rd October 1919 in Bushey, Watford,
            Hertfordshire, where she lived with her parents Emily and Walter,
            and her sister Margaret, who was born in 1922. She lived in Bushey
            until spring 1925, following an argument between Emily and Walter,
            where, we suspect, she learnt that he had a wife and family in
            Connecticut. Emily along with the two girls, herself pregnant,
            travelled to Windsor. Evelyn recalled travelling into Windsor
            Central Station, by train, and crossing over the river and Bath
            Island and seeing buttercups in bloom on the island. In Windsor they
            moved around quite a lot, from one room to another, close to the
            town centre. in August 1925 they were living in Alma Cottages, South
            Place, where her brother Leslie was born. Life was hard, Emily was
            working, in service, and Evelyn was at school and having to look
            after the two younger children. There were stories, from Evelyn,
            that when they were a little older, and during school holidays, she
            would go with friends around the long walk or over the Brocas,
            "dragging" the younger children with her, and of her and her friend
            giving Leslie piggy backs .
          </p>
          <p>
            Evelyn was a prolific writer, much was written when she was a Sunday
            School teacher at the Baptist Church in Dedworth, Later she would
            write about her childhood and the early years in domestic service.
