          <h2>Historical Context</h2>
          <p>Notes.</p>
          <p>
            The story of Alice (peggy) Vickers has many twists and turns, having
            contracted Polio at a very early age, she spent many months in
            hospital, in Oxford where for a long period she was in an Iron Lung,
            and at that time, during the late 1920's Early 1930's, her parents
            could only visit once a month, this was due to transport costs and
            the distance between Windsor and Oxford.When she first returned home
            she had two calipers one on each leg, she was keen to get rid of at
            least one caliper, which she did manage to do. Her brother, Bert,
            also tried to help, at one point he modified the caliper so that it
            was just the knee joint, but this of course failed. It was Bert who
            gave Alice her nickname of Peggy, modified from Peg leg.

            In the 1939 listing, we find Peggy living at home in Clewer Fields
            with her parents, and she has the occupation of Laundry worker. At
            this time there are a couple of Laundries in Windsor, but the Steam
            Laundry was possibly the one that she worked at, this I have assumed
            to be correct due to comments made, like the fact that she would
            often see her father working on t he furnaces at the GAs works,
            which was on the route from the Steam Laundry to Clewer Fields.
