        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Leslie was born on 26th August 1925 at No.4 Alma Cottages, In Windsor,
          These cottages were demolished and the area is now part of Ward Royal,
          The actual location of the cottages is the entrance to the car park,
          behind "The Hope" public house on Alma Road.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1928 Emily, Leslie’s mother married Arthur Weeks, this was not a
          very good situation, for stories told by Leslie’s sister, Evelyn,
          Arthur would take no notice of the girls but would spend a lot of time
          with Leslie, whether this was a story out of Jealousy we will never
          know. But the marriage did not last for long. In Leslie's early years,
          during school holidays , Leslie would be looked after by Evelyn, See
          Evelyn's
          <a href="../writings/Evelyns writings- part 2 - Early Years.html"
            >writings</a
          >
          for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          in 1939 Leslie was working as a "house boy" at Eton College, the job
          was probably arranged by Evelyn, as she was already working there at
          this time. The job as a House boy did not last long, Leslie did not
          like it so got himself a job as a plumber mate at Wellmans, in Peascod
          Street, Windsor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know, from documents, that Les enlisted into the army on 28th
          September 1944, at Hereford, His occupation, at that time was listed
          as "Pipe Fitter Mate", he trained as a Driver Operator; a role for
          which he passed on 26th October 1945, shortly after his 18th birthday.
          He was demobbed on 14th February 1948, which makes a service length of
          3 years and 139 days. He was posted to the 9th Queen’s Royal Lancers
          “A” Squadron as a Driver Operator as part of the RAC RECCE In January
          1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have been awarded the 1939-1945 General Service War Medal
          plus Palestine clasp
