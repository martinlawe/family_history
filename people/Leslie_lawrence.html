        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Leslie was born on 26th August 1925 at No.4 Alma Cottages, In Windsor,
          These cottages were demolished and the area is now part of Ward Royal,
          The actual location of the cottages is the entrance to the car park,
          behind "The Hope" public house on Alma Road.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1928 Emily, Leslie‚Äôs mother married Arthur Weeks, this was not a
          very good situation, for stories told by Leslie‚Äôs sister, Evelyn,
          Arthur would take no notice of the girls but would spend a lot of time
          with Leslie, whether this was a story out of Jealousy we will never
          know. But the marriage did not last for long. In Leslie's early years,
          during school holidays , Leslie would be looked after by Evelyn, See
          Evelyn's
          <a href="../writings/Evelyns writings- part 2 - Early Years.html"
            >writings</a
          >
          for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          in 1939 Leslie was working as a "house boy" at Eton College, the job
          was probably arranged by Evelyn, as she was already working there at
          this time. The job as a House boy did not last long, Leslie did not
          like it so got himself a job as a plumber mate at Wellmans, in Peascod
          Street, Windsor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know, from documents, that Les enlisted into the army on 28th
          September 1944, at Hereford, His occupation, at that time was listed
          as "Pipe Fitter Mate", he trained as a Driver Operator; a role for
          which he passed on 26th October 1945, shortly after his 18th birthday.
          He was demobbed on 14th February 1948, which makes a service length of
          3 years and 139 days. He was posted to the 9th Queen‚Äôs Royal Lancers
          ‚ÄúA‚Äù Squadron as a Driver Operator as part of the RAC RECCE In January
          1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have been awarded the 1939-1945 General Service War Medal
          plus Palestine clasp
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          His actual role during his period in the army is still being
          investigated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we did not get to hear too many of his stories from
          this time as he was frequently closed down. We do know he spent time
          in Italy, and that he assisted his colleagues when they were trying to
          communicate with the local girls, he would often go as a translator to
          the family homes. That being said, it never really registered that he
          spoke fluent Italian, which he probably learnt during his time in
          Italy. there were also stories from his time in Palestine, nothing
          operational, but stories about having his meal stolen by a bird, or
          nearly getting court marshalled for loosing his rifle through neglect,
          in fact he lost 14 days pay for this.

        <h3>What Was the RAC Recce (1945‚Äì47)?</h3>
        <p>
          RAC Recce stands for
          <strong>Royal Armoured Corps Reconnaissance</strong>. It was a
          reconnaissance unit of the British Army tasked with gathering
          intelligence and scouting enemy positions. From 1945‚Äì47, many units
          were stationed in postwar occupied Germany and Italy, and others in
          British-controlled areas of the Far East.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Germany:</strong> Occupation, border patrol, security, and
            administration duties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Italy:</strong> Support in post-fascist regions to stabilise
            governance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Far East:</strong> British Empire reoccupation forces
            (Burma, Malaya, India).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Blues and Royals (Postwar)</h3>
        <p>
          The name <strong>Blues and Royals</strong> was officially used from
          1969 after the merger of the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues) and the
          Royal Dragoons (The Royals). Les may have served with one of these
          precursor regiments, and the term may be used retrospectively in
          documents.

        <b>üöô Typical Equipment</b><br />
        In 1945‚Äì47, RAC Recce units would often be using:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Daimler Dingo</b> scout cars<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Humber Scout Cars</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Staghound Armoured Cars</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ Sometimes even <b>light tanks</b> (like the Stuart) depending on the
        theatre<br />

        Les was a Trooper in the 9th Lancers, a Driver Operator, and was
        deployed to Montabello in May 1946. He returned to England in February
        1948 from Egypt.<br />
        <b></b> <b>His Role: Driver Operator</b><br />
        In cavalry/armoured regiments like the 9th Lancers:<b></b>

        ‚Ä¢ <b>Driver</b>: Operated armoured vehicles (possibly a Daimler Armoured
        Car, Humber Scout Car, or similar light recce vehicle)<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Operator</b>: Handled <b>radio communications</b>‚Äîvital for command
        and coordination during reconnaissance and patrol missions<br />
        He would have been part of a <b>small crew</b>, likely 2‚Äì3 men per
        vehicle, trained to:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Maintain and drive the vehicle across rough terrain<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Operate <b>wireless sets</b> (like No. 19 set)<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Relay orders and intelligence from patrols to HQ<br />
        This was a highly skilled role‚ÄîDriver Operators were trusted with both
        mobility <i>and</i> battlefield awareness. In a postwar setting, that
        meant <b>frontline visibility</b>, often out in the field while keeping
        eyes and ears open.<br />
        <b></b> <b>üáÆüáπ Montabello, Italy (May 1946 onward)</b><b></b>
        <b>Context:</b>‚Ä¢ British forces in Italy were transitioning from
        <b>combat troops to occupation/stabilisation</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ The 9th Lancers would‚Äôve been part of the
        <b>British Forces in Italy (BFI)</b>‚Äîkeeping the peace, supporting
        Italian authorities, and patrolling volatile zones<br />
        Leslie's duties there may have included:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Mobile patrols</b> of roads and rural areas<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Convoy escort</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Monitoring partisan activity</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ Serving as a <b>visible peacekeeping presence</b><br />
        Northern Italy, especially in areas like Veneto (where Montabello
        Vicentino is), still had tensions from:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Anti-fascist partisans<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Returning POWs and displaced people<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Friction between local political factions<br />
        <b></b> <b>üá™üá¨ Egypt (Late 1946 ‚Äì Late 1947)</b><br />
        After Italy, the 9th Lancers were likely moved to
        <b>Egypt as part of the British garrison in the Middle East</b>,
        probably stationed in or near:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Cairo</b>‚Ä¢ <b>Alexandria</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>The Suez Canal Zone</b><b>Duties:</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ Garrison duties and training<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Support for operations in <b>Palestine</b> (troubles were escalating
        there in 1946‚Äì47)<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Strategic presence to secure British interests in the region<br />
        Egypt in this period was heating up politically‚ÄîBritish presence was
        increasingly resented, and nationalist movements were rising.<br />
        <b></b> <b>üá¨üáß Return to the UK (Feb 1947)</b><br />
        By early 1947, many wartime soldiers were being <b>demobilised</b> under
        the "Age and Service" scheme. His return in February suggests:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ He likely received <b>Class A release</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ May have been processed through <b>Woolwich</b>, <b>Catterick</b>, or
        another demob centre<br />
        ‚Ä¢ He‚Äôd probably have been given a <b>demob suit</b>, pay, and rail
        warrant home<br />

        Les <b>returned to the UK on 24 November 1947</b> from
        <b>156 Transit Camp</b> aboard <b>H.T. Otranto</b><b></b><br />
        <b>üö¢ H.T. Otranto ‚Äì The Troopship</b><br />
        <b>H.T. Otranto</b> (short for <i>Hired Transport Otranto</i>) was a
        <b>British troopship</b> operated postwar by the Ministry of Transport.
        Originally a passenger liner, it was used extensively in the 1940s to
        ferry troops and returning personnel between overseas bases and the
        UK.<br />
        By late 1947, it was doing regular runs from:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Middle East</b> (Egypt, Suez Canal Zone)<br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>Far East</b><br />
        ‚Ä¢ <b>India</b><br />
        ...back to <b>Southampton</b> or <b>Liverpool</b>.<br />
        <b></b> <b>üõèÔ∏è 156 T/Camp</b><br />
        The ‚Äú<b>156 Transit Camp</b>‚Äù was likely one of the
        <b>demobilisation staging camps</b> in Egypt, probably near
        <b>Port Said</b> or <b>Tel el Kebir</b>, both of which were major
        British military hubs at the time.<br />
        These camps handled:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Final paperwork<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Medical checks<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Kit turn-in<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Issue of travel document<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Waiting for space on returning ships like the Otranto<br />
        <br />This would have been the final stretch before Les boarded ship,
        after which it was a <b>sea journey of about 10‚Äì14 days</b> depending on
        the route.<b></b> <b>Historical Vibe: November 1947</b> To put this in
        context:<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Britain was beginning to <b>pull out of Palestine</b> (huge tensions
        there at the time)<br />
        ‚Ä¢ The Cold War was brewing<br />
        ‚Ä¢ Nationalist movements were pushing hard across Egypt<br />
        ‚Ä¢ British demobilisation was winding down, but
        <b>thousands of troops</b> were still coming home<br />
        Les‚Äôs return in <b>late 1947</b> places him among the
        <b>last major waves of demobbed WWII servicemen</b> still on overseas
        duty‚Äîhe served well beyond VJ Day, which adds to the significance of his
        service.<br />
