            53rd (City of London) HAA Regiment: India Deployment<br />
            Arrival in India: The 53rd HAA Regiment disembarked at Bombay
            (Mumbai) on 1 May 1942 <br />
            Subsequent Movement: By 19 May 1942, the regiment had relocated to
            Calcutta, leaving 159 Battery behind at Bombay<br />
            Official Deployment Reference: One account notes the unit ‚Äúmoving to
            India in May 1942‚Äù<br />
            Probably part of the initial convoy to India, that long gap between
            departure and arrival makes sense in context:<br />
            <em><u>Why the voyage took months</u></em
            ><br />
            Route choice ‚Äì In late 1941 and early 1942, troop convoys from the
            UK to India could not go through the Suez Canal (due to Axis
            presence in North Africa) without heavy risk. Many went the long
            Cape route via South Africa, across the Indian Ocean to Bombay.
            Stops for refuelling, provisioning, and convoy assembly ‚Äì Troops
            often spent weeks at staging posts like Freetown (Sierra Leone),
            Durban or Cape Town, and possibly Aden or Mombasa before final leg
            to Bombay. Naval escort schedules ‚Äì Convoys sometimes had long
            layovers waiting for safe escort across submarine-threatened waters.

            A story that Barry recalls from Bert - I remember dad telling me
            they were sleeping on the deck of the troop ship and he was worried
            that he could sleepwalk overboard so went below deck, his mate Jack
            Randall woke up to find dad missing and sounded the alarm for man
            overboard only for dad to come up and ask who was missing!!!! you
            can imagine the stick he got for that.

              British <b>Heavy Artillery Corps</b> in the Burma Campaign is a
              fascinating angle, because the terrain and climate made
              traditional heavy artillery usage challenging. But they
              <i>were</i> there, and they played some key roles, especially in
              the later phases of the war when logistics lines improved.
            </p>
            <b>British Heavy Artillery in Burma (1940‚Äì1945):</b><br />
            <b>Role and Deployment</b>
            <p>
              Early in the campaign, there was <i>limited use</i> of heavy
              artillery due to the dense jungle, poor roads, and monsoon
              conditions. As the campaign evolved (especially from 1943‚Äì1945),
              heavier guns were brought in to support major offensives like
              <b>Imphal</b>, <b>Kohima</b>, and the <b>drive to Rangoon</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artillery was used extensively in <b>defensive fire support</b>,
              <b>bunker-busting</b>, and in coordinated
              <b>creeping barrages</b> with infantry advances.
            </p>
            <b>üîπ Units Involved</b><br />
            <p>
              <b>Royal Artillery (RA)</b> had multiple heavy and medium
              artillery regiments attached to the
              <b>British Fourteenth Army</b> under General Slim.
            </p>
            Units were often rotated and included:<br />
            ‚Ä¢
            <p>
              <b>Medium Regiments</b>: Typically equipped with 5.5-inch guns.<br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>Heavy Regiments</b>: Often had 7.2-inch howitzers or older
              60-pounder guns.<br />
              ‚Ä¢ Artillery support was coordinated under divisional and corps
              artillery commands (e.g., XXXIII Corps, IV Corps).<b
                ><br /><br />
                üîπ Equipment Used</b
              ><br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>5.5-inch Gun (BL)</b> ‚Äì Workhorse of medium artillery.<br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>7.2-inch Howitzer</b> ‚Äì Used in heavy regiments; good for deep
              bombardment.<br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>25-pounder field guns</b> were also widely used, but
              technically not in the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù class‚Äîthey were the backbone of
              artillery across all fronts.<b
                ><br />
                <p>üîπ Notable Actions</p></b
              ><br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>Battle of Imphal (1944)</b> ‚Äì Artillery was used effectively in
              defensive roles, repelling Japanese assaults.<br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <b>Kohima Ridge</b> ‚Äì Artillery fire played a major role in
              halting the Japanese advance.<br />
              ‚Ä¢ During the <b>advance on Meiktila and Mandalay</b>, coordinated
              barrages were essential in breaking Japanese defenses.<b
                ><br />
                <br />üîπ Challenges</b
              ><br />
              ‚Ä¢
              <strong>Transporting heavy guns</strong> through jungle and
              mountainous terrain required ingenuity‚Äîelephants, bulldozers, and
              even airlifting in parts.<br />
              ‚Ä¢ Monsoons turned roads into rivers, limiting mobility and ammo
              resupply.
