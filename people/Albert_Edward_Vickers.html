        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Albert Edward Vickers was born on 20th March 1890, youngest son of
          Henry and Eliza Vickers. From the 1901 Census, Albert was 11 years old
          and probably still a scholar, at this time he was living with his
          parents, at 61 Victoria Cottages (formally Edwards Square), along with
          brothers James and Arthur and sister Ellen. By 1911, Albert was a
          Butcher, living at 16 Victoria Cottages. During the early part of the
          century, Albert was playing football for Windsor and Eton, appearing
          in the local press an number of times. By 1915 Albert had enlisted and
          was a Sergent with the Royal Rifles, Service number S2703, and was
          part of the Machine Gun Corps.

        <h2>Military Notes</h2>
        <p>
          On 22nd December 1917, Albert is recorded as being in Hospital in
          Kent, having been wounded in the chest and Arm. [full details not
          known currently] Albert was awarded the Military Medal on 24/04/1918
          This Level 3 Gallantry Medal was established during the First World
          War on the 25th March 1916 and introduced in the London Gazette issue
          29525 (back dated to 1914) to personnel of the British Army and other
          services, and personnel of Commonwealth countries, below commissioned
          rank. It was the other ranks' equivalent to the Military Cross (M.C.),
          (which was awarded to Commissioned Officers and, rarely, to Warrant
          Officers, who could also be awarded the M.M.) The military decoration
          was awarded to A.E.Vickers for acts of gallantry and devotion to duty
          under fire or for individual or associated acts of bravery which were
          insufficient to merit the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conferment of the medal was announced in the London Gazette and
          A.E.Vickers earned the right to add the letters M.M. to his name.

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>21-04-1918</b> Very quiet day. No casualties. A considerable amount
          of work was done improving posts and constructing a continuous apron
          of wire in front of front line.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>22-04-1918</b> A very quiet day. No casualties. Work as on 21st.
          “A” Company took over one company front on the right up to, but not
          including the <b>VILLIERS BRETONNEUX WARFUSEE Road</b> from one
          company 2 East Lancs. Regt. this relief was carried out without

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>23-04-1918 to 24-04-1918</b> A Patrol, consisting of 2 Lt P.G.
          McCubbin and other ranks left our lines at 2am 23rd inst to
          reconnoitre the right of our front. One Rifleman, wounded, reported at
          Battalion Headquarters at about 3am that 2nd Lt. McCubbin had been
          wounded, also some members of the Patrol. Another Patrol was
          immediately sent out, no trace the first patrol, which seems to have
          walked into an enemy post, could be found. 2 unwounded members of the
          first patrol eventually returned to our lines. 2nd Lt. McCubbin was
          “Missing”. 2nd Lt. J. Farrell joined for duty. Reports received that
          enemy would attach at dawn obtained from prisoners captured on the
          right of our sector. No attack developed, probably owing to wet
          morning. A quiet day. Work done improving our line and wiring posts
          continued. A new MG post made in our line near Battalion Headquarters.
          Some enemy gas shells at night. Reports again received late that enemy
          would attack at dawn on 24th. Enemy observed working in
          <b>VILLIERS BRETONNEUX – WARFUSEE Road,</b> fired on by our Lewis guns
          and rifles from our line. Reported to Division by Brigade Major. Heavy
          enemy barrage came down at 3.45am. This continues until about 7am,
          when it became less intense, and chiefly covered ground between
          Reserve line and Battalion Headquarters. Barrage included a large
          proportion of Gas Shells. Continual reports received from Os.C.
          Companies that barrage was not on Front Line or Close support
          Companies during the above hours. During the night 23/24th ½ D Company
          had been moved into close support on the right and half on the left by
          order of G.O.C. 25th Infantry Brigade. The morning was very misty and
          the enemy put down a heavy smoke barrage at dawn, making it impossible
          to see for more than 20 yards. About 7am a runner form “A” Company
          reported at Battalion Headquarters that the enemy had got round the
          right flank of the company, and was attacking them and the support
          platoons of <u>“D” Company </u>from flank and rear, and was moving
          towards “C” Company. At 8am “B” Company was ordered to form a
          defensive flank, joining with support platoons of
          <u>“D” company </u>and remains of “C” Company, from “B” Company’s
          right to reserve line. Battalion HQ details moved forward to continue
          the line covering Battn. Headquarters and in touch with 2nd R.
          Berkshire Regt. on the right, N.W. of <b>VILLIERS-BRETONNEUX</b>. 2nd
          Lt. Gurrier and elements of A C & D Coys joined this line during the
          morning. At 9am enemy Very Lights were seen going up on N.W. outskirts
          of <b>VILLIERS-BRETONNEUX </b>and enemy machine guns opened fire on
          vicinity of Bn. Headquarters. Reserve line and vicinity of new line
          joining with 2nd Royal Berkshire Regt. was shelled at intervals all
          day. B Company on the left was subjected to heavy trench Mortar fire
          at intervals, the enemy advanced several times on the right of this
          company, but each time driven off by rifle and machine gun fire. It
          was afterwards ascertained that the enemy, after breaking through
          <b>SOUTH of VILLIERS BRETONNEUX – WARFUSEE Road,</b> had turned in
          Northwards, between our front line and support lines and also in rear
          of the latter, being unobserved owing to the dense mist and smoke
          barrage. A & C Companies taken unawares in the rear were overwhelmed
          after a sharp fight by superior numbers of the enemy, the whole of the
          two Companies with few exceptions being killed or captured. Very
          little was ascertained as to their exact fate, but it is known that
          one Platoon of D Coy. fought to their last man, as was completely
          wiped out. 2nd Lt. Doyle, was dangerously wounded while commanding
          this Platoon, was found on the night of the 24/25th during the
          counter-attack by the Australians. The remainder of the day passed
          without further attacks on our front , with the exception of
          half-hearted attempts to turn the right flank of B Company which were
          frustrated by the effective fire , brought to bear on them by this
          company. On the night of 24/25th a counter-attack on
          <b>VILLIERS BRETONNEUX </b>and ground SW of the village, was carried
          out by a Australian Brigade, which surrounded the village,
          establishing itself on the Eastern outskirts as far as the Old Hangars
          on the<b> VILLIERS BRETONNEUX WARFUSEE Road</b>, with its right flank
          thrown back. Its left covered the Northern and North Western parts of
          the village, and was extended to eth right flank of our B Company,
          where this Company bent back, forming our defensive flank. The
          Australians left at this time was not in touch with B Company’s right,
          but the gap was covered by the continuation of our line joining up
          with the 2nd Royal Berkshire Regt. Our lines were shelled at intervals
          throughout the night.
