          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p>
            Albert Edward Vickers was born on 20th March 1890, youngest son of
            Henry and Eliza Vickers. From the 1901 Census, Albert was 11 years
            old and probably still a scholar, at this time he was living with
            his parents, at 61 Victoria Cottages (formally Edwards Square),
            along with brothers James and Arthur and sister Ellen. By 1911,
            Albert was a Butcher, living at 16 Victoria Cottages. During the
            early part of the century, Albert was playing football for Windsor
            and Eton, appearing in the local press a number of times. By 1915
            Albert had enlisted and was a Sergent with the Royal Rifles, Service
            number S2703, and was part of the Machine Gun Corps.
