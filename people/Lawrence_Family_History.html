<p> This family story begins with <a href="Laurence,_John_(M).html">John Laurence</a>, who was born in the mid-1700s—possibly in St Albans, although Watford is also closely associated with the family's early roots. John married Elizabeth (surname unknown), and together they had a son, <a href="Laurence,_William_(M).html">William Laurence</a>, born in 1790. </p> 
<p> William married Charlotte Knowles in 1806, and their son <a href="Laurence,_Thomas_(M).html">Thomas Laurence</a> was born in Watford in 1817. In 1844, Thomas married <a href="Emmons,_Myra_(F).html">Myra Emmons</a>, who was born in Whatfield, Suffolk. Her father, <a href="Simon_Emmons.html">Simon Emmons</a>, was born in 1792. </p> <p> <a href="suffolk_history_1830_to_1839.html">In the early 1800s</a>, 
life in rural England was harsh. Work was scarce, wages were low, and poor harvests made even basic sustenance difficult. In 1838, Simon Emmons was caught stealing seed and grain from a local storehouse—likely an act of desperation. At the time, Britain regularly transported convicted criminals to penal colonies. Simon was sentenced to seven years' transportation to Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), 
where he died two years later in 1840. </p> 
<p> Following her father’s conviction and death, Myra appears to have moved to Watford—possibly to live with extended family or to seek work. </p> 
<p> In March 1856, <a href="Lawrence,_Walter_(M).html">Walter Lawrence</a> was born to Thomas and Myra. He was the sixth of ten children, with three older brothers and five younger sisters. </p> 
<p> In 1879, Walter—then working as a painter and decorator—married <a href="Evans,_Ellen_(F).html">Ellen Evans</a> in Watford. They had at least two children: <span class="disabled">Mary</span> (b.1882) and <span class="disabled">Gertrude</span> (b.1883). </p> 
<p> In 1883, the family emigrated to America, settling in Woodtick, a rural area in Hartford County, Connecticut. During this time, many British skilled workers emigrated to the United States in search of better prospects. The American economy was expanding, and tradesmen like Walter often found more reliable employment across the Atlantic. While in the U.S., <span class="disabled">Walter Lawrence Jr.</span> was born in 1888. </p> 
<p> According to census records, by 1910 Gertrude had returned to live with her parents in Connecticut, bringing her son <span class="disabled">Kenneth</span> with her. Around this time, Walter Sr. made the unexpected decision to return to England—alone. The reasons for his return remain unclear, but it seems to have been a permanent separation from his first family. </p> 
<p> Circa 1916, back in Watford, Walter met and eventually <strong>married</strong> <a href="Archer,_Emily_(F).html">Emily Archer</a>. His wife and children remained in America, this was a case of bigamy—a criminal offence at the time. Socially and legally, this would have carried serious implications. </p> 
<p> Walter and Emily had three children together: <a href="Evelyn_Lawrence.html">Evelyn</a> (b.1919), <span class="disabled">Margaret</span> (b.1922), and <a href="Leslie_Lawrence.html">Leslie</a> (b.1925). During Emily’s pregnancy with Leslie, she discovered Walter’s previous marriage and family in America. According to family accounts, the revelation caused a major confrontation, with reports of raised voices, objects thrown, and even the police being informed. </p> 
<p> Emily left Walter shortly afterwards and returned to Windsor to live with her mother. Evelyn later recalled travelling into Windsor Central Station in the spring of 1925 and looking out at fields of buttercups on Bath Island. The family lived briefly in Kepple Row before settling, for a short period, at No. 4 Alma Cottages, where Leslie was born. </p> <p> In 1926, Walter returned to the United States, this time permanently. He rejoined his original family and appears in the 1930 U.S. Census living once again with Ellen and Walter Jr. </p>
