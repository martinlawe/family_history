  <h1>Welcome to Our Family History</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>This archive brings together the stories of our direct ancestors across the centuries. 
    Each branch explores a different family line, combining narrative history with photos, timelines, and documented records.</p>

    <!--<p>To begin exploring, select one of the family groups below. Within each section, youâ€™ll find blue links to individuals, 
    showing what information we currently have available.</p> -->
  </div>

  <h2>ðŸ“– About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This family history project began with the goal of preserving our shared pastâ€”not just names and dates, 
    but the stories, decisions, and circumstances that shaped each generation. It draws on data compiled in RootsMagic, 
    family letters, oral recollections, and wider historical research from local and national archives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some family lines trace back centuries, touching on nobility, migration, and military service. Others are more modest, 
    telling quiet stories of working lives, local ties, and resilience across difficult times. This site aims to bring them all together in one place.
  </p>

  <h2>ðŸ§­ How to Use This Site</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Click a family group below to view that branch of the family tree.</li>
    <li>Pages include links (in blue) to individual profiles, each offering further detailâ€”birthplaces, spouses, children, occupations, and relevant historical context.</li>
    <li>Not all histories are complete. Sections marked in grey are still in progress and will be updated as more information becomes available.</li>
    <li>You can return to this homepage at any time using your browser's Back button or by bookmarking the siteâ€™s main index page.</li>

<!-- General notes - things to do next - Reshuffle css file to a more logical sequence
Check button colours, and get things common- Check each tree uses buttons, not links when rendered- 
Once everything is looking consistent, and working Publish to Git.
Look to use Jekyll for templating, hopefully to reduce file sizes.
Add more people files to the project, removing disabled links and buttons.
Create additional Family History pages.
Look to add more photos to relevant person files.
