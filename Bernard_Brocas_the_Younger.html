      <h2> Life and Career of Sir Bernard Brocas</h2>
			<p>		
			Born around 1354, Bernard the Younger inherited his father's estates and the office of Master of the Royal Buckhounds. He married Joan, daughter of either Sir Thomas Middleton or Gilbert Banbury, and they had at least six children. 

			Bernard the Younger was involved in the Epiphany Rising of 1400, a failed plot to assassinate King Henry IV and restore Richard II to the throne. He was captured, tried for treason, and executed by beheading at Tyburn on 5 February 1400. Despite his conviction, King Henry IV allowed his widow to retain her dower and restored the family estates to their eldest son, William Brocas, later that year.
