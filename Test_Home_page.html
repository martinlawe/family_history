        This family history project began with the goal of preserving our shared
        past—not just names and dates, but the stories, decisions, and
        circumstances that shaped each generation. It draws on data compiled in
        RootsMagic, family letters, oral recollections, and wider historical
        research from local and national archives.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 40px">
        Some family lines trace back centuries, touching on nobility, migration,
        and military service. Others are more modest, telling quiet stories of
        working lives, local ties, and resilience across difficult times. This
        site aims to bring them all together in one place.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 40px">
        Pages include links to individual profiles, each offering further
        detail—birthplaces, spouses, children, occupations, and relevant
        historical context.
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 40px">
        Not all histories are complete. Sections marked in grey are still in
        progress and will be updated as more information becomes available.
