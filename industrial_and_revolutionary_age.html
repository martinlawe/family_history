			<p><em>The Industrial and Revolutionary Age in the UK and Ireland (c. 1800–1914)</em></p>
	
			<p>The Industrial and Revolutionary Age, spanning from the mid-18th to the early 19th century, marked a turning point in the lives of families across Britain and Ireland.</p>
			<p><strong>In Britain</strong>, this period saw the rapid growth of factories, mills, and mines, particularly in the North and Midlands. 
			New inventions like the steam engine transformed industry and transport, and towns swelled as people left the countryside for work. 
			This shift brought both opportunity and hardship — while some families gained steady wages, many faced harsh working conditions, long hours, and poor housing.</p>

			<p><strong>In Ireland</strong>, the picture was different. Industrial growth was slower and largely centred around Ulster, particularly Belfast's linen industry. 
			Much of the country remained rural and impoverished, and the social and economic pressures of the era — including land struggles and rising population — would eventually contribute to massive emigration, especially during and after the Great Famine (1845–1852).</p>
			

			<p><strong>Politically</strong>, the revolutionary ideas sweeping Europe inspired reform movements, including calls for workers' rights, Catholic emancipation in Ireland (achieved in 1829), and later, campaigns for parliamentary reform and home rule. 
			These upheavals helped shape the world in which our ancestors lived, worked, and made their choices — sometimes migrating, sometimes resisting change, but always adapting to a rapidly shifting world.</p>
