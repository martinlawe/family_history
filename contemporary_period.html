			<p><em>The Contemporary Period in the UK and Ireland (1945–present)</em></p>

			<p>The decades since World War II have brought profound social, economic, and political change to the UK and Ireland.</p> 
			<p>The postwar years saw the introduction of the Welfare State in Britain — with the NHS, social housing, and education reforms improving life for many working families. 
			Industry gave way to service and technology sectors, and mass migration from the Commonwealth and Europe reshaped communities.</p>

			<p>In Ireland, the second half of the 20th century was marked by recovery, modernisation, and conflict. 
			The Troubles in Northern Ireland (late 1960s–1998) brought decades of violence and division, often along religious and political lines, affecting many ordinary families in both North and South. 
			The eventual peace process and the Good Friday Agreement (1998) marked a new chapter.</p>

			<p>In recent decades, both countries have seen shifts in identity and society. 
			Deindustrialisation, EU membership (and later Brexit in the UK), growing urbanisation, and changing social attitudes have transformed daily life.</p> 
			Families today live with far more mobility and opportunity than previous generations, but also face new pressures — from economic uncertainty to questions of national and cultural identity.</p>

			<p>The contemporary period is one of reflection as well as progress, where families look back at inherited stories and forward to an ever-changing future.
