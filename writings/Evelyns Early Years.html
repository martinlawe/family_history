      <h1>Writings of Evelyn Watts <br />(Nee Lawrence)</h1>
      <p><strong>[Transcribed by Martin Lawrence 2023]</strong></p>
      <h2>Forward</h2>
      <p>
        The following are the direct wordings used by Evelyn, in her writings. I
        have not made any changes to the wording used in my transcription.
        Therefore, I will apologise in advance if you find anything here
        upsetting. It must be remembered that when Evelyn wrote this, the
        terminology used was acceptable. It should also be noted that had I made
        any changes, this then would not be Evelyn’s writings, but a variation
        on those writings, with my interpretations.

        Childhood memories by Evelyn Watts 1919 to 1933
      </h2>
      <p>
        We lived with my grandparents in Keppel Row<sup

          Connecticut, America.</span
        >, then went into a front room in Alma Cottages near Higley the
        Stonemason’s, where my brother was born<sup
          ><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup
        ><span id="fn3" class="footnote-content">Exact date unknown</span>. We
        often moved it seemed in those days, into one room. Coal and water had
        to be carried up the stair. We used candles and oil lamps. My mother
        tried to get us a council house in Dedworth, (but though her name was on
        the list for over 30 years, it never reached the top). We did eventually
        get a house in Alma Cottages. The rent was 16/-<sup
          ><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup
        ><span id="fn4" class="footnote-content"
          >16/- was 16 shillings – there were 20 shillings to the pound, so in

        a week. It was four rooms and a scullery. The toilet was outside. It was
        like a palace to us, but was too expensive so after a while we moved
        into a cheaper one, 10/6d<sup
          ><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup
        ><span id="fn5" class="footnote-content"

        >
        a week, in Clewer Fields. It was an old pub, The Napoleon, made into
        three houses. We had the end house with a tiny garden back and front. I
        was about 11 years of age when we got our first house.
      </p>
      <p>
        School holidays we never stayed around the house; we would have been
        found a job had we done so. Being the eldest, everywhere I went I had to
        take my sister and brother with me. We walked miles, we picked
        Milkmaids<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup
        ><span id="fn6" class="footnote-content"
          >Milkmaids are a common wild flower called cuckoo flower</span
        >
        in Runnymede. We knew where all the wild flowers grew. At Eton Wick in a
        stream grew Watercress. The gypsies chased us away from there should
        they have been there first. Also in Eton Wick was a field where we
        picked Red Hot Pokers, a red conical-shaped clover. In a field near The
        Brocas grew Seabies and by the railway arches near the Eton swimming
        pool, grew the everlasting grass. The Brocas then was yellow with
        Buttercups. A beautiful sight. Brocas Lane<sup
          ><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup
        ><span id="fn7" class="footnote-content"
          >We called it Brocas Lane, but it is Meadow Lane</span
        >
        ran along the back of The Brocas, with hedges either side. One side had
        a ditch and with the many small trees made nice little hidey holes.
        After we discovered several old fires in them we decided tramps used
        them, so we kept away. Along the lane grew a crab apple tree, which we
        climbed. The branches formed a kind of ladder. It was up there I tore my
        new knickers.
      </p>
      <p>
        New clothes did not come our way very often. My brother was the
        luckiest. His suits with two pairs of trousers cost 7/6d<sup

      </p>
      <p>
        It was always summer, or so it seemed to be. We would take a bottle of
        cold tea or a bottle of water, should we have a half penny<sup
          ><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup
        ><span id="fn11" class="footnote-content"

          half pennies to a shilling and a shilling was equivalent to 5p</span
        >, we would buy a tablet of lemonade or ginger beer to add to the water,
        and with sandwiches of bread and jam would set off for the day. Walking
        through the Long Walk gates<sup
          ><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup

        (now gone) we would go to the copper horse, and come autumn we would
        gather chestnuts. The boys would sell theirs to the greengrocers. We
        always ate ours. The Windsor Forest I knew like the back of my hand. We
        knew where to find the bluebells, primroses and monkey orchids.
        Rhododendrons grew everywhere. Now all that has gone and houses are now
        there. So sad! Going to the river we passed through the Duke Street
        allotments and picked a few runner beans to eat as we went along. My
        mother told us, when she was a child, she and her sister had picked the
        runner bean flowers and taken them home for their mother, who had
        chastised the pain of them. They had also gone to the Spital Cemetery
        and taken flowers off the graves, thinking they were for anyone. They’d
        taken them to school for the teacher, to get into her good books. It was
        the teacher who split on them by thanking my grandmother, when she saw
        her, for the lovely flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        After school, every day I had to call on my Great Aunt Emma,
        grandfather’s sister, she lived in Victoria Street Alms Houses<sup
          ><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup
        ><span id="fn13" class="footnote-content"
          >Actually called "Windsor Alms House"</span
        >. I did her shopping, mostly at Liptons<sup
          ><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup
        ><span id="fn14" class="footnote-content"
          >In 1939 Lipton Ltd – Grocer was at 114 Peascod Street</span

        and Saunders<sup><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup
        ><span id="fn15" class="footnote-content"
          >In 1939 Saunders Ltd Chemist was at 41 St Leonard's Road</span
        >, they were the nearest shops. She often changed her mind when I got
        back with the groceries and I had to change them. I hated going back to
        the shops. At the end of the week, for payment, I’d get an apple or a
        piece of cake or a half penny. I preferred the money.
      </p>

        Saturday morning pictures at the Empire<sup
          ><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup
        ><span id="fn16" class="footnote-content"

          Castle, and the Empire on the Right, opposite the entrance to “Windsor
          Yards”</span
        >. (the Flea Pit) cost 2d each. I carried my brother in, pretending he
        was asleep if he didn’t have enough money. It took a lot of running
        errands all week to get the admission money together. Once in the cinema
        attendants would try to get order. Once the little band came in (they
        were silent films) we would set up a cheer. Those who could read would
        do so aloud. We must have been a horrible lot. I remember eating a stick
        of celery behind an old lady. The more she complained the more I
        crunched in her ear. During the interval the usherettes would come round
        with the flit spray<sup><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup
        >.
        <span id="fn17" class="footnote-content"
          >Flit spray was an insecticide used in cinemas to kill flies and
          Mosquitoes</span
        >
        During the evenings we would play under the street lamps, making an
        awful lot of noise, I expect. One old lady in particular, a Mag Johnson,
        would throw bowls of water over us, which made us all the noisier. May
        Day we decorated ourselves and hoops with May blossom, which we picked
        along Imperial Road, and went around the houses chanting “The first of
        May is garland day. Give me a penny and I’ll go away”.
      </p>
      <p>
        We didn’t have many toys, a ball if we were lucky until we lost it. A
        skipping rope, which was always obtainable from the Greengrocer; it was
        a flat plaited rope and came off the orange boxes. They were long and
        wooden with a centre piece dividing the box and we made dolls houses or
        cupboards with a curtain in front. Most families had them. All sorts
        could be kept in them, from saucepans to shoes. I once had a china doll
        from saving OXO wrappers. It came in an OXO base and van. We also had a
        “Sunny Jim” from Force. He stood about 10” high ans was in one piece. He
        wore a Top Hat and frock coat, and I think he had a horn on the back of
        his head. My mother once brought home some stuffed toys from where she
        was working as a “daily”. I chose a Pekinese dog in a rick orange
        velvet. My cousin visited us, saw it and I had to give it to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        My brother had his hair cut at Mr. Pecks in Lower Peascod Street,
        opposite Oxford Road. That cost 9d. My sister’s and my hair was cut at
        “Bunny’s” in Oxford Road for 6d. Later I had my first perm there, strung
        up for £1. I had gone into a perm club for 1/- a week for 20 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could get quite a lot of specks for a penny from “Groves” in Peascod
        Street, if we were lucky. They were damaged or bruised fruit. When the
        market came to the council yard in Goswell Road, on the corner of Oxford
        Road, the fruiterers there sold hands of bananas for 9d. Often the
        fruiterer would have half a dozen children stand up and each was given a
        banana to eat, to prove how tasty were his wares. At David Gregg's we
        often took a pudding basin and brought 6d worth of cracked eggs. At
        Denny’s the bakers we bought stale cakes. A bag of the day befores'
        cakes, about 8 for 2d, and once a week we would go to Kirby’s the bakers
        in Peascod Street (near where Daniels is today) for cake cuttings. A
        large bag full for 2d. How pleased we were if we had a piece of cake
        with cream on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never minded getting up early in the morning. Just as well, I
        suppose, as once a week I took a clean pillow case and 6d and walked to
        Barnes Pool Bridge in Eton to the college bakery, meeting other children
        on the way. We would get a pillow case filled with stale bread. On a
        cold winters day the baker would often give us a hot roll. We would
        count the cyclists going to Slough, as we walked along. We wouldn’t
        dawdle as we had to be back in time for school and we dare not be late.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Brookes the butchers came to Windsor, Where Fishers<sup
          ><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-Ref">18</a></sup
        ><span id="fn18" class="footnote-content"
          >Fishers Butchers closed in 2023</span
        >
        is now, they sold hot Pease pudding and faggots and a shop in Victoria
        Street, where the men's Hairdresser is now, sold home-made paste with a
        kind of fat on the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother worked at Eton College during the terms, and often she would
        bring home a basin of dripping, with lovely thick jelly gravy at the
        bottom. She would then give us fried bread for our breakfast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking up to High Standing Hill, we would always call at a certain
        house for a cup of water. They had a pump in their front garden. It was
        a novelty I expect. We were never refused a drink. The left hand lodge
        gates led to what we called Rhododendron Walk. The gates on the right
        took us to where the Primroses grew. We were not supposed to pick them,
        but we did, and had to hide them from the keeper as we passed his house.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went to the Baptist Church three times on Sunday. Morning, Afternoon
        and Evening. Sunday mornings we attended a meeting going into the church
        for the last half hour. In the afternoon we attended Sunday School,
        getting a star stamped on our cards. We had Sunday Clothes which were
        never worn during the week. Sunday School was held in the large room
        upstairs. Up an iron stair case. We sat on long seats in classes. The
        Superintendent sat on a wooden platform. Once a month we had a farthing
        Sunday, when each class would vie with each other to get the most
        farthings. We were told it was to build the church Hall at the rear of
        the church. Now gone. Sunday evenings after church we would go to our
        grandmothers. If it was fine we would all go for a walk, if not, we
        would be given a book to read. If we looked up we would be told to stop
        listening to the grown ups talking. Children were supposed to be seen
        and not heard. We never went out to play on a Sunday. The Sunday School
        treats were the only ones we had. The Summer Outing to Burnham Beeches
        was looked forward to for weeks, we travelled in coal carts with straw
        under foot and sang all the way. It must have taken ages to get there,
        but times was something we had plenty of and never worried about it.
        Once there, we got established under a large tree, then our teachers had
        a bit of peace or took us for walks. It seemed a huge place, with many
        very large old trees and a small fair ground. If we had sixpence to
        spend we were rich. The boys always went to high slope and slid down on
        tin trays or whatever was handy. We picnicked for tea and decorated the
        poor horse and coal cart with ferns, mostly, for the return journey back
        to Windsor. A few years later on, we travelled to Burnham Beeches in
        lorries with forms along the insides , and had tea in a long barn-like
        tea room. Then, when I was 10, I saw the sea for the first time at
        Littlehampton. At that time, all the Sunday Schools in Windsor went
        together on a special train. Later on we went by coach to the sea, but
        Littlehampton I can always see in my minds eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Christmas party was another big even, a tea, games and a present off
        the Christmas Tree. (I realised later on that how hard our teachers
        worked for us, when I became a teacher in the chapel in Dedworth and
        made dolls, gollywogs and dogs, for my pupils). We were given and apple
        and orange as we left.
      </p>
      <p>
        We played a lot on the Acre. There were plenty of seats then which in
        turn became a shop or house. There was also a railed in tank. The boys
        always said there were dead soldiers in it. We didn’t climb over the
        rails to find out. Bonfire night, the streets around the Acre had their
        own bonfires, Acre Passage always had a huge one, which was always
        guarded. The boys made their Guy Fawkes and took them round the streets
        in prams and trolleys, covered over. It was “a penny a look”. The money
        collected was spent on 1/2d and penny bangers. The noisier the better.

          Grade II‑listed terraced buildings dating from around 1830. They
          feature early 19th‑century stock‑brick architecture, with No 37
          distinguished by its stucco front, shop‑style ground‑floor window amid

          their architectural and historic value</span

        in Victoria Street did a roaring trade. The guys ended up on the
        bonfires, some of which were very small. Crowds gathered to see them
        all. It was a grand sight but of course some-one always spoilt it by
        throwing fireworks into the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school clinic was held in a tall building by the Acre, behind where
        the Liberal Club is now<sup
          ><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup
        >.<span id="fn20" class="footnote-content"
          >Now an office block occupied by a solicitor and a cafe</span
        >
        Nurse Hart was in-charge, it seemed. Mothers took their babies to be
        weighed and bought welfare food. The clinic later moved to the rear of
        the old British School. A really beautiful building now pulled down and
        a tall red brick building erected. That stands opposite Alexandra Road
        in Victoria Street. A brewery stood where the Multi Storey car park is
        now. Nurse Hart was the “nit nurse” as we called her. Children with
        dirty heads wore white nit caps and sat away from other children in
        their class. The sweet shop next to the Baptist Church I always remember
        for its honey-comb in a large blue box and blue bird nut toffee with its
        little hammer in the tray with which to break it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another place to play was the Alexandra Gardens. It had more flower beds
        than now and all along the sides were flowers. No-one destroyed them.
        The trees with branches touching the grass were good places to hide
        under and were used for all kinds of games. Ena Beswick, a blind
        girl<sup><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup
        ><span id="fn21" class="footnote-content"
          >Evelyn’s words, today we would tend to use “Visually Impaired”</span
        >, would read us stories from her Braille book, when home for the
        holidays. There was a summer house also where we played when it rained.
        The pond<sup><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup
        ><span id="fn22" class="footnote-content"
          >This has been replaced by the Sun Clock, this was done a number of
          years ago. The Big Gates have not been there for many years.</span
        >
        near the big gates contained gold fish and the boys used to put the fish
        they caught in the river into the pond also. On a family gathering
        there, my cousin Cyril, from Chalvey, was showing off in his new sailor
        suit. He was proudly walking on the cement rim of the pond when I pushed
        him in. “What a commotion it caused. My mother ran round the pond one
        way my Aunt Minnie, Cyril’s mother, the other-way. Cyril was covered in
        green slime from his sailors hat to his shoes and yelling. So was I,
        after both mothers had caught me. A large cannon stood by the pond on
        which we climbed and a band stand stood near by, which was used every
        Sunday. It drew a lot of people. Sometimes my mother gave us a half
        penny cornet, but sometimes we were given a penny sno fruit from the
        Walls “Stop me and buy one” bicycle. Along the river was a small summer
        house with four compartments, over which we would climb. It is now a tea
        place. Nearby stood a Nestlés chocolate machine, the penny chocolate on
        show very tempting, but far too expensive for us. We used to paddle from
        the tree nearby to the island. The water coming up to our bottoms. Great
        care was taken as the river bed was very soft should one venture too far
        to the right.

        The swimming baths where we went mostly with our school was just a part
        of the river. The changing booths can still be traced by the large slabs
        of concrete still in their original row. Should they be occupied we had
        to use an arch with forms along the sides. A Mrs June was an instructor
        who fitted us into a harness attached to a rope on a long pole. Along
        the side of the cement bank was fixed a pipe on which we held on to do
        our leg movements. The water being cold one day I wasn’t too keen to get
        into it and so was pushed in. I never went swimming again until I had
        left school, then I bought a sixpenny inflatable ring and learnt to swim
        on the Eton side of the river. In the changing huts, we always seemed to
        be happy, maybe away from the teachers eye. I well remember singing
        “Horsey keep your tail up” doing the actions standing on the seat to
        everyone either side amusement. After that I was always asked to sing
        it. My voice never was very melodious. The Eton baths were worse than
        ours. We at least had a shallow end.

        In those far off days we all had to make our own amusements, but though
        we dressed our cat up and dragged her around in a tomato box for a pram,
        I am sure we had a far better time that the children of today, who have
        many beautiful toys, even their own radios and go abroad for their
        holidays. We had our freedom. Could walk for miles and be safe. If we
        misbehaved any adult would tell us off. A policeman clipped my ear and
        took me home when I was caught scrumping at the back of Boots on Thames
        Hill. I wasn’t quick enough climbing over the wall.

        In Oxford Road was many shops and six pubs, and the Black Boy off
        licence.

        There were then many roads around that area. At Valentines we always
        bought vinegar and mustard pickles loose. Cranes crowded little shop
        kept everything the working man wore, from Oxford shirts to heavy boots.
        Mrs Butler kept a second hand shop. Cooks the butcher, Vickers
        newsagent, Horden the corn chandler, Heathers shoe shop, two sweet
        shops, Mrs Bennet owned one, Mr Guy the barber, Mrs. Bucket green
        grocers, Grubs the Fish shop, Paris for fish and chips. There were more
        but I forget them. They’ve all gone now to make way for Ward Royal.

        Ascot week, youngsters went to Queen Annes gate, by the Great Park to
        watch the race goers returning, who threw coppers out to the children,
        watching them scrambling for them. I was taken once up there, playing
        hooky from school. I was supposed to have collected my sister and
        brother from school. When I failed to do so, they had to find their own
        way home. So off to my school, went my mother, and discovered I had been
        absent all afternoon. She thought I had been kidnapped and ran to the
        police station. I returned home clutching nine-pence, a small fortune to
        me and was promptly marched off to the police station for a telling off.
        I believe all this was stopped after a boy was killed by a vehicle,
        while turning cart-wheels in the road.

        On Empire day every child wore a daisy and we marched to the Home Park
        where we sang “Jerusalem” and other patriotic songs. The daisy centre
        stood for Great Britain, the many petal represented our Commonwealth. A
        very large fair was held on the Brocas every August. We loved to watch
        the women making humbugs, throwing the mixture over hooks and stretching
        it. When the grass was cut we had the time of our lives, spending all
        day there making cubby houses in the hay. At Fanny Rose’s second hand
        shop, where Hoskin’s Fish Shop is today, we took two penny comics and
        got one in exchange. Windsor today, is very different from the Windsor I
        knew as a child. Gone are the many allotments and farms, The Windsor
        forest has been eaten into for housing. We are told it is progress.
        Everything changes. Henry Francis Lyle says in “Abide with me”, Change
        and decay in all around I see. Oh Lord who changeth not abide with me.
        Charles Wesley says “Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and
        wane, but the Church of Jesus Constant will remain. Only our faith can
        withstand all changes. Jesus is the same, yesterday, today and forever.
