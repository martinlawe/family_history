      <h1>Writings of Evelyn Watts <br />(Nee Lawrence)</h1>
      <p><strong>[Transcribed by Martin Lawrence 2023]</strong></p>
      <h2>Forward</h2>
      <p>
        The following are the direct wordings used by Evelyn, in her writings. I
        have not made any changes to the wording used, in my transcription.
        Therefore, I will apologise, in advance if you find anything here
        upsetting. It must be remembered that when Evelyn wrote this, the
        terminology used was acceptable. It should also be noted, that had I
        made any changes, this then would not be Evelyn’s writings, but a
        variation on those writings, with my interpretations.

      <h2 class="section-title">My Years in Domestic Service l933 to l943</h2>
      <p>
        On my 13th birthday I realised I had only one more year at school, then
        I was to go into service. That last year could not pass quickly enough
        for me. I did not care much for school. History I liked best of all but
        can only remember one date, The Battle of Hastings 1066. Henry VIII
        fascinated me and I could never learn enough about his reign. My school
        Clewer St.Stephens was the best school in Windsor. Its Headmistress Miss
        Butterworth was a demon. Most girls were scared of her. Some teachers
        disliked her. I remember once when my last teacher, Miss Johns was away
        sick, Miss Butterworth took my class 6B for English. We had to learn a
        part of Macbeth which goes — ”Is this a dagger which I see before me,
        the handle towards my hand, come let me clutch thee. I have thee not and
        yet I see thee still. Art thou but a vision, etc. ” Miss Butterworth
        said it through to us and really scared us stiff. We were glad when Miss
        Johns returned. She was by far the better teacher. She confiscated our
        sweets if we were caught eating in class and we were always being given
        lines. Mostly 100. Mine mostly were ”I must not talk in class”. When
        very bad we sat in the hall on the floor cross legged. My gymslip had a
        large patch at the back. The A side of the school was mostly for girls
        going into office work. The B side was for domestic and other work.
        Clewer St. Stephens was a very strict school. Uniforms had to be worn.
        White blouse, green and yellow tie, navy blue gymslip, navy blue
        knickers (with a pocket) and black shoes and stockings. Shoes had to be
        changed in the cloakroom and plimsolls put on. In winter we wore navy
        blue coats and hats with a badge in front. In summer we wore panama hats
        with a badge. Woe betide any girl caught not wearing a hat. When my
        sister reached senior school black stockings had been changed to white
        socks. I well remember one morning when I went to school in a jumper as
        my one and only blouse wasn't ironed and I was made to stand up in the
        Hall whilst everyone else sat down and was really told off. I only had
        the one blouse which had to be washed, dried and ironed the night before
        school. My sister had two blouses when I left school. As we were poor we
        three had to go to St. Michael‘s Home in Dorset Road with other girls
        for our mid-day meal. We hated having to walk in a crocodile I sat next
        to Sister Howe who always gave me the fat off her meat. I hated fat but
        always ate it being too scared to refuse it.’ She suggested that on
        leaving I went to be trained for service. So Mother, Sister Howe and
        myself went by train to Clapham Common to a private school. The staff
        were all the ‘Home' girls, cheap labour. ' Everywhere in the servants
        quarters were large signs, Silence, No Talking. The servants always
        hurried. A depressing place. At the interview I couldn't stop crying and
        begged Mother not to leave me there. She didn’t like the place either.
        Sister Howe wasn‘t very pleased when Mother said No I was not going
        there, and she never suggested another ”place” In the evenings when
        Mother wasn't too tired she would tell us of her years in service before
        she married. She worked in a large establishment with many servants,
        ladies maids, and some even kept cows and hens. One old cowman, Amos,
        always gave my Mother cream to drink. Dairy maids were kept. My Mother
        worked in the kitchen with her sister. They lived well but had to work
        hard. They had one day off a month when they came home to Windsor and
        gave most of their wages to their Mother. A Mrs. Allen who kept a
        Registry Office<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>
        <span id="fn1" class="footnote-content"
          >The agency was actually "The Servants Registry Agency"</span
        >
        in Thames Street where the King George Memorial is now always got my
        Mother her jobs so I was taken there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I applied for and got a house parlour-maid's job to the Organist at St.
        George’s Chapel in the Cloisters at Windsor Castle<sup

          >Actually No. 12 Horseshoe Cloisters, Windsor Castle, Windsor,
          SL4 1NJ..</span
        >. A Cook was the other servant kept. I had two of everything to go into
        service with, I exchanged one uniform for another. In the household was
        Dr. (later Sir) and Mrs. Harris and their younger daughter Miss Ann
        Patricia but called Miss Squibs. Miss Margaret being away at school at
        Calne. She came home for holidays. Miss Squibs was a 10 year old plump
        child who always seemed to wear fairisle jumpers and a kilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her socks were knitted by the cook, Dorothy, who never seemed to be
        without her knitting needles in her hands. When Madam went out shopping
        I would be called from my work upstairs to clean the kitchen, scullery
        and pantry. Dorothy would stand by the window with her knitting and
        watch for Madam to come through the archway when she would send me back
        upstairs. I would then be told off by Madam when she came in for not
        working fast enough. I never answered back.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a large rambling tall house. The hall seemed miles long when I
        had to polish the red tiles on my knees. The four or five long stone
        steps leading upstairs were cleaned with cold starch water and hearth
        stone, no small wonder my hands were always covered with bleeding chaps.
        I was allowed to go off duty tor an hour every afternoon. My half day
        every week and every other Sunday was from 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock.
        Should Madam discover any dust when she went round the house with a
        hairpin in a white handkerchief my half day was stopped and I had to
        clean the inside of the windows instead. They were long leaded windows.
        How I hated them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miss Squib was forever snatching off my mob-cap and hiding it. I would
        then be told off for not wearing it. I kept quiet. The servants toilet
        was outside by the coal shed. A creepy walk when it was dark carrying
        the large key. The Curfew Tower was only a few feet away and my
        imagination would run riot. I still went to Sunday School every other
        Sunday. I was then in the ‘Bible Class at the Baptist Church. We were
        Baptists my Grandmother was a &quot;daily” at the home of Mrs. Baxter.
        Her son was the organist at the Baptist Church. (He later married a Miss
        Oliver a Sunday School teacher the day war broke out, Sept.l939).
      </p>
      <p>
        Often I had to take Miss Squib to the Eton Recreation field instead of
        going off duty. A previous maid had left her stranded there and returned
        to her home in Eton Wick never to return. No one it seemed stayed long.
        In the coal shed were names and dates of previous house parlour-maid's.
        I added mine in due course. Work there was really hard. No modern
        cleaners in those days, long stiff brooms for sweeping carpets. The dust
        flew everywhere. My knees were soon like leather with so much kneeling.
        One spring—cleaning time Mrs. Harris hired an electric hoover. The man
        came to demonstrate how to use it using sand to show how it sucked up
        the dirt. After spring~cleaning it was sent back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cellar though never used was cleaned every so often. I was sure that
        the cellar was haunted. The light switch was outside the door and of
        course if Miss Squib was around and I was down in the cellar she'd turn
        off the light-and lock the door. Often I was cleaning silver at 9
        o‘clock at night. For all this I was paid £14 a year, £1.3.4d a month
        (£1.17p) and was often told I was never worth it. Though not happy there
        I was told by Mother and Mrs. Allen I had to stay for 2 years to get a
        reference. I stayed nearly two years leaving during the summer holiday
        and went to Wotton House, Eton College where I was paid £16 a year as
        under house—maid on the private side.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had bought more uniform while at Dr. Harris‘s house mostly from Miss
        Bird‘s shop in Lower Peascod Street. She was a Methodist and held a
        weekly meeting called The Band of White Ribboners. She sold maids
        uniforms, morning and afternoon aprons cost l/lld, mob—caps 6 3/4d,
        afternoon caps 9d. My black stockings from Ethel Wiles shop in Oxford
        Road cost 6 3/4d a pair. When I had more money I bought a brand called
        ”Fearless” that had double knees and heels. I helped wait at table in
        the boys hall for breakfast, lunch and sometimes supper. At my previous
        place I had my own room, now I shared with the third parlour-maid. Our
        room was through two attics. Very creepy. The long window looked out
        towards the Bath Road to Slough. It was a pleasant room in summer but in
        the winter the ice formed on our water jugs on our washstands.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were not allowed to light a fire and our blankets were very thin so
        we froze at night. My Mother bought me a flock eiderdown for a Christmas
        present. Once or twice I took a few knobs of coal and made firelighters
        from newspapers. (One of my jobs was making firelighters, no sticks for
        fires) and we had a fire. It was lovely we covered the glass panels on
        our bedroom door and laid a mat across the bottom so no one could see
        see the flickering fire. We were never found out.
      </p>
      <p>
        War broke out while I was there. It didn’t make a lot of difference to
        us except our light bulbs were changed for much dimmer ones. We were
        already on rations for sugar, 1/2lb weekly and butter 1/4lb weekly. I
        always had plenty of mending to do in the afternoons l was on duty.
        Staff sheets when thin were turned sides to middle, then top to bottom,
        after that they were made into under pillow slips, from them to slop
        cloths and then rags. Nothing was ever wasted. The head housemaids never
        stayed long. Work was done the hard way. The Dame was a tyrant, always
        seemed to have her finger on the bell button. Her evening clothes were
        laid out on the bed every evening after tea by the Head housemaid. When
        I did it on the Head‘s afternoon off, I sometimes forgot to put her
        evening bag and handkerchief out, so, on the bell she pushed in her
        sitting room and up a parlour-maid would run several flights of stairs
        to answer the bell only to be told that it was me that was wanted. Up I
        would go and was told off to fetch the bag and the handkerchief which I
        took into the sitting room on a silver salver. The sitting room was four
        doors along from her bedroom'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would she get the same treatment these days? It was the Head Housemaids
        honour to mend her clothes, I cleaned her shoes, using milk to clean her
        patent leather ones. One Head Housemaid I remember well, she was old,
        couldn't get up in the mornings at 6 o‘clock. I was down at least a 1/4
        hour before that. We worked by the clock and I had to help her do her
        work as well as my own. Winter was the worst time when the coal fires
        were on. The brass canopies and fenders got discoloured as soon as the
        fires were lit and took a lot of hard rubbing to clean. The rind of a
        lemon helped a lot. From Kathleen I learned a lot. She’d been around a
        long time. Furniture supposed to be polished every day(no spray on
        polishes those days) just got a rub over and a tiny bit of polish was
        put on the fire throwing out the smell of polish. My job was the
        cleaning out of fires, blackleading them every morning} sweeping the
        carpets with a long handled stiff broom, polishing floors and cleaning
        the washstands. Even if the bathroom was next.to the bedrooms, chambers
        and washstands were used. The Dames ivory figures were supposed to be
        washed in milk. They weren‘t. Carpets had used tea leaves sprinkled on
        them to hold back the dust and bring out the colours. Kathleen also
        stuck china ornaments she broke with the white of eggs. She was also
        supposed to do the Dame‘s mending. When she left it was discovered
        pushed to the back of the drawer. She didn't stay long.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were not well fed. Sunday breakfast was one very tasty sausage. When
        the boys had a roast joint the head parlourmaid would quickly carve some
        slices off for our tea hiding it in a serviette. I can still remember
        the roast pork. Delicious. One night we were really hungry so we three
        young ones (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> parlourmaids and myself)
        crept down the many flights of stairs and raided the larder. One saucer
        contained 6 peas, we left one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day the cook was mad. The boys got the blame. We were never
        suspected but we never did it again. One cook we had was really mean
        with our food. We didn't even get any jam for our tea. During one spring
        cleaning we heard the cook had died. It appeared she had a Boarding
        House at Bexhill on Sea and had been supplying her house with food and
        goods meant for us. The Dame of course had been sent for and was n't
        very happy to have to leave her holiday cottage in Taunton. It was
        during her discovery of linen under the cook's bed that the railway
        porter came for a trunk bringing back an empty one, a weekly event.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cook's son who had also arrived was really gone to town on. We
        learnt then that was the reason our food had been so poor and bed linen
        and tea towels had disappeared from the laundry baskets. I don’t know
        how it ended up after the Dame had laid down the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year the Dame had many tickets given to her to pass on to the
        staff to attend a dance in Eton behind the Post Office. How we young
        ones longed to go, but no, the Dame said only the boys' maids could go
        as it was too late for us to be out as we had to be up early the next
        morning. Our half days were from 2.30 to 9.30. The boys’ maids took the
        tickets but never went. We three decided we would go but the problem was
        how.? Most nights the boys got out but their friends let them in. The
        night watch patrolled at set times, punching a ”tell—tale” clock on each
        floor. The only way out for us was by the fire escape, through our two
        attics, creeping past the scullery maids and head parlourmaids rooms,
        past the staff bathroom and through a very long attic to the fire
        escape. The iron ladder had no hand rails until it reached the boys
        landing. When I saw that fire escape a few years ago I shuddered. I
        never realized how dangerous it was then or how very brave or stupid we
        all were. On reaching the small platform by each boys landing window we
        had to make sure the Dame and Tutor were not around. They each went into
        the boys rooms every night to say good—night. The end of the fire escape
        was a good six feet from the ground but we managed. We enjoyed the dance
        but my boy friend who I had fallen out with refused to help us get back
        on the fire escape. My friends had not been able to find a fellow to
        help us so we decided to try to move the large dustbins and climb up on
        them. We failed to move any of them so had to ring the bell at the back
        door. The night watch let us in putting our names down in the book. Next
        morning the boys knew all about it. While serving their breakfasts many
        boys commented on the fact that we got caught, they never did. The Tutor
        put flour and salt on the window sills thinking that was how the boys
        went out and returned. They had a key to their door besides a friend to
        let them in. We had decided to stick together. If one got the sack the
        other two would leave also.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dame was furious with us but staff were hard to get so she wrote to
        our Mothers instead of sacking us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The years passed and when the last head housemaid left I asked once
        again if I could be considered for the post. I was 22 years old then.
        I’d done the job so often with no extra pay. I was refused, probably I
        was too useful as I was so I gave notice. I was getting £20 a year. No
        more was I going to keep sweeping up the Laburnam flowers that kept
        blowing in through the Dame's bathroom window or answer the everlasting
        ringing of her bedroom bell. I decided my next job would be as a
        parlourmaid, I‘d had enough training. My friend and her sister who
        worked in another house had gone back to their village in Durham, their
        Mother being worried about the guns etc here. We spent a lot of time in
        the air—raid shelter in the field next to our house. I had spent some
        summer holidays up north with my friends and got on well with their
        family so I decided to go with them. They made me welcome but of course
        I had to get a job My friends went into an ammunition factory at
        Aycliffe. I did not want to join them so went as parlourmaid to Mr.
        Nimmo, a Brewer at Castle Eden. An elderly gentleman, a teetotaller. His
        daughter Joan was housekeeper. Another daughter had evacuated herself to
        the house along with her husband, child and nanny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life would have been a lot easier had the two women got together before
        issuing orders. I knew my job and often had to &quot;dig my heels in”.
        Often the dining room was used for nursery tea parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        l was expected to clear it away and wash up. I stuck out and when nearly
        dinner time came around the Nanny realizing I wasn't cleaning it up had
        to do it. She must have thought I was soft but soon found out I wasn't.
        I always pointed out there was a schoolroom available but then she knew
        she would have to clean that up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally the Nanny was called up and Mrs. Mac.— had another baby and a
        Scotch Nanny. We were all up in arms about her. She insisted on hanging
        the baby‘s dripping washing on lines in the kitchen though there was the
        house laundry only a few feet away from the house run by an old servant.
        Alice with help from the daily helpers. Alice's Father had been the
        Master‘s Coachman many years before.
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening during a dinner party the children were both yelling. The
        Nanny being out. The parents took no notice. The housemaid refused to go
        to the nursery so I went up to the children in between serving the
        dinner and sang to them My voice never was very melodious but they
        finally went to sleep. The atmosphere was bad. The Nanny left and the
        ”Blue Nanny&quot; came back. She had been called up for the WAAFS but
        got her discharge as she was pregnant. One way of getting out of the
        services. She in time bought up her child with the other two children.
        It was the best job I’d ever had. I got £1 week and my uniform provided,
        even grey stockings. The food was good, best I‘d ever had. The Master
        went shooting on his friends estate am; there was no shortage of meat.
        There was also a pig kept. One had just been slaughtered who was called
        Eileen. Every time she was served in the dining room they reminisced on
        her life. Many were the stories I heard. The gardener. under-gardener
        and boy looked after the gardens, lawns and greenhouses. The black and
        green grapes hung in huge bunches. Thinnings of grapes were made into
        pies and served up on Whit Sundays.
      </p>
      <p>
        The house stood in the centre of a wood. Very dark and quiet it was
        going through it on my half days but I was never afraid. The gardener’s
        bungalow was on the edge by the small gate we used..
      </p>
      <p>
        In Spring the wood was full of daffodils. We servants were allowed to
        pick a bunch to take home on our half days. The gardener always kept
        potted plants in tiers in the large entrance hall. The daffodil bulbs
        were later planted in the wood.
      </p>
      <p>
        One job the garden boy disliked was the finding and digging out of a
        rabbit borrow a Sealyham dog which belonged to another daughter who
        often visited with her Children and nanny. The dog being so small always
        managed to get stuck. Our dogs a Scotty and a spaniel were too big.
      </p>
      <p>
        A passage was reinforced into an air—raid shelter. The Master would put
        on his tin hat and patrol on the lawn during an air raid. We often saw
        the sky lit up when the towns were bombed. Stockton, Middlesborough,
        Hartlepool. Then we would just sit and wait hoping we would be missed. I
        would have our dogs on my lap much to Mrs. Macs- annoyance. She said I
        should be nursing her children. I preferred dogs.'. One night returning
        from my half day after an air raid 1 was going through the little gate
        into the wood when a voice shouted &quot;Halt, who goes there”. A
        soldier came from behind a haystack. Apparently a parachute had come
        down in the area from a hit German plane. The Soldier escorted me to our
        back door. Soldiers were billeted in the Village. We had officers. A
        whisky drinking Colonel one time. After a while with stocks going down I
        was told to say there was no more whisky. The Officers Batman came every
        day to clean their officers uniforms and equipment. Mrs. Macs~ husband
        who was an Army Captain, something to do with the docks at Hartlepool
        expected the Batman to clean for him as well. The Batmen expected to be
        paid. They weren’t so they &quot;never had time&quot; after the first
        time- I was then expected to do it. After holding out for a long time I
        condescended to give it a &quot;rub over”. Eventually he had to do it
        himself. -New uniforms were made for us in pink and white cotton for
        mornings. A maroon dress for afternoons. I had a frill on my morning and
        afternoon caps. Our aprons were large with bows at the back. we never
        gave up coupons.

        Spring cleaning was hard work. We had a daily help. The attic floor was
        scrubbed white. It contained a lot of beautiful black oak furniture} one
        of the Master‘s three wives collected it. There were also trunks of
        school clothes and civvy clothes belonging to the only son to survive
        out of 19 children but then was killed in the first world war. Five
        girls also survived. In one large spare bedroom were cupboards full of
        silver cups and cutlery belonging to all the children. These were
        cleaned once a year. The house had many cups and large silver table
        lamps as well as a huge wooden crate containing old fashioned silver
        urns, brushes and combs. I only ever got as far as the top layer.

        The cook baked bread and cakes for the week on Fridays. The bread in
        tins was placed on the fender of the cooking range. Oh, yes, at spring
        cleaning carpets were cleaned by the housemaid, daily and myself on the
        lawn. The men servants would carry them out and lay them down on the
        lawn. We beat them then the carpets would be pulled over and beaten
        again. Then we all pulled them over the lawn.

        I attended the Primitive Methodist Church in Station Town and the
        Salvation Army. I was in a ”Peace” play at the Methodist Church
        representing Portugal. I was given time off for practices and the giving
        of it.

        After two years my call up papers arrived. Had I worked in the Brewery
        part~time I wouldn't have been called up. The Master gave me extra pay,
        said I was the best parlour~maid he'd had and promised me my job back
        after the war. I didn‘t drink, kept the wine cellar door locked and only
        gave the men their one bottle of beer for their 10 o’clock break. I was
        sorry to leave but had no choice. I came back to Windsor to work for
        McMichael’s in Slough and so ended my 10 years in service. I never went
        back to Castle Eden except to visit.
