      <p class="question">
        Where did you grow up and what was your childhood like?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        My first recollections are from living in the cottage in Clewer Fields,
        Windsor, we lived at No. 14, an end of terrace, 2 up 2 down with an
        outside toilet. Dad's sister Evelyn lived next door with my Grandmother.
        The other side, beyond the garden, lived my other Grandmother. When mum
        was in hospital with Chris, I remember being at home and Dad cooking
        "Bubble and Squeak" for breakfast, and going to pick up mum and Chris
        from hospital.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Whilst you lived in Clewer Fields was there anything else that stood
        out?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I remember playing in the garden, it was at the side of the house, and
        we had a copse, I guess it's what it would be called, but it wasn't that
        big, of Black current and red current bushes, but much taller than I
        was, and during the season, I would spend hours in this copse, eating
        fresh fruit.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What are your recollections of your first school?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        I remember going to Holy Trinity School, which was a two minute walk
        along the Alley. I attended this school from January 1958 through to
        July 1958. There was not a great deal to remember from my first school,
        I do have vague memories of it being cold, and the milk, which came in a
        metal crate, being taken into the class room, and placed in front of the
        radiator, to warm it up. I have never liked warm Milk, so I was not
        impressed.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        In October 1958 we moved to Burnetts Road, Dedworth. From the September
        1958, I attended Dedworth Green Primary School in Smiths Lane, only a
        ten minute walk from our new home, but from September I had to catch a
        bus from Clarence Crescent, Windsor, to Manor Road in Dedworth each
        morning and the reverse every night. I was put on the bus, in the
        morning by mum, and collected from the bus, in Dedworth, by mum's cousin
        Ivy, then the roles were changed in the afternoon. The bus conductor
        would make sure I got off at the right stop. This routine continued
        until we moved in October. Those early years at Dedworth Green Primary
        were not that memorable.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I moved up to Dedworth Green Junior School in the September 1960.
      </p>
      <p class="question">How was your time at Junior school?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        The first years at Dedworth Green Junior were nondescript.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        However the final couple of years were more memorable, at the end of the
        summer term we had a swimming Gala, as we had our own swimming pool,
        which was also open to us at various times through the summer holidays.
        Academically, I was just outside the top ten in my class, and I had the
        opportunity to sit the Eleven Plus to see if I would go to the Grammar
        School, fortunately I failed, although one lad, who always finished
        below me in the class tests, passed (I've never been able to work that
        one out). I this final year we had a school trip, that Ii was fortunate
        enough to be able to go on, which was a week away, travelling to
        Blankenberg in Belgium, via Dover and Ostend, and then a couple of days
        in Paris, before returning to Blankenberg, where we also had a day trip
        to Holland, to a miniature village. In my final year I was made a
        prefect.
      </p>
      <p class="question">Was Secondary School memorable?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Secondary School was Dedworth Green Secondary Modern, situated on the
        same campus as the Primary and Junior schools, but a lot bigger, where
        the Junior School had probably 360 pupils across 4 years, the secondary
        Modern school had around 500 pupils across five years, The early years
        were like the Junior school, nondescript. I had had an interest in
        History, but we had to make a decision in the third year of what
        subjects we wanted to continue with, unfortunately History did not fall
        into the group of subjects that I wanted to follow.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        In the Fourth Year we had a school trip, originally we were going to go
        to Spain, the journey was to be by train, through France, but at the
        time we were due to travel, the French Rail Network was going to be on
        strike, so it was announced that we would be going to Rimini in Italy,
        instead, and in order to do so, would travel to Dover, and the ferry
        across to Ostend, where we would board a train that would take us to
        Basel, in Switzerland, Skirting around France, at Basel, we had to
        change trains, within the same station, but the second train would take
        us to Rimini. We stayed in Rimini for a week, with a day trip to Venice,
        as I remember, and then most of the remaining time was spent on the
        Beach, and at a funfair that was on the edge of the town. The return
        trip from Rimini, was a bit of a nightmare as we had to travel
        overnight, but did not have any overnight accommodation on the train, so
        had to make do with bench seats or luggage racks.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The final year at school, had its ups and downs, we did not have a
        science teacher, so arrangements were made for use to attend Windsor
        College, once a week, to be taught by a teacher from the Grammar School.
        this was not that successful and I really did not understand what he was
        trying to teach us. Also during this final year I was moved from a GCSE
        Maths group to a CSE group, where the syllabus was completely different,
        but the teacher could not understand why I did not know, or understand
        what he was teaching, A complete disaster. It was in the final year that
        we had our own study room, where we would congregate during break times,
        one day, it was decided that we would remove all the desks and chairs
        from the room, and stacked them in the lobby, the form tutor was not
        impressed, but did see the funny side of things.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        How did you get to school? today many school pupils are driven to
        school, was that the same in your day?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        When I first started school I could walk, as it was only a matter of
        yards to school, then when I moved to Dedworth Green, I had to catch a
        bus, for a short period, then I was able to walk each day, as we only
        lived half a mile for the school. At that time everybody walked to
        school, a few were able to cycle to school, but having parents dropping
        them off at the school gates was unheard of.
      </p>
      <p class="question">where there lots of after-school clubs?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        No, is the short answer, there were very few after school clubs, however
        in saying that we were able to play out side, most of the year, the only
        stipulation was that we had to be home when the street lights lite,
        other than that we had freedom to go where ever we liked, and most of
        the time our parents had no idea where we were, and had no means of
        contacting us, there were no mobile phones in my day.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What else was memorable about your childhood?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        The visit to the dentist was always memorable, especially if you were in
        the chair at 10:45, when the guards changes at Windsor Castle.<br />
        At some point, in the mid Sixties currently trying to work out when I
        joined a Dig at the Bray Gravel pits, where a Roman villa was found.
        Whilst I know exactly where this villa was, I have no idea of when it
        occurred, and the local Archaeological society have not been that
        helpful.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        What activities were you involved with during your childhood?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I was a member of various groups in my early years, I was a cadet with
        the St Johns Ambulance brigade, providing first aid cover at the theatre
        Royal in Windsor and occasionally at the rugby Club which was located on
        Home Park, I believe the club is still there. I remember one incident,
        where a player received a knee injury, we were called to assist, and
        bandaged him up, as per our training, he then limped off to the changing
        room, then reappeared, having re bandaged his knee so that he could bend
        it, he did get back on the pitch but only lasted a few minutes before
        having to come off.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Youth Clubs were also quite good, during the mid 1960's, the local
        Baptist church had one, and there was another in Windsor, these usually
        operated on one day during the week, and the one in Windsor I used to
        play draughts, where I won a medal.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Attendance of the Baptist Church Youth Group in Dedworth depended on
        attending Church on a Sunday morning, I was joining the Sea Cadets which
        also met on a Sunday morning, but, although I was prepared to attend the
        Baptist Church on a Sunday evening, you gave me an ultimatum either I
        attended church on a Sunday morning, and therefore could continue with
        the Youth group, and therefore leave the Sea Cadets. or I continued with
        the Sea Cadets bout would have to leave the Youth Group. I have never
        been back to that church.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        From 1967, I was a Sea Cadet on TS _Windsor Castle_, initially a
        land-based facility in the old brewery behind the Theatre Royal — now
        just a car park. We later moved to a ship, originally built for the
        Danish Royal Family around 1911. It was first moored outside the ‘Donkey
        House’ before being towed to a new berth near the Windsor swimming pool
        and the Ricky Tick club. Moving the ship was an adventure in itself. To
        begin with, the river level had to be raised by about six inches, as the
        ship had grounded near the Windsor Weir. Once the water was high enough,
        the tow could begin — but crossing the stream proved tricky, thanks to
        the strong flow from the weir. As we approached the Windsor and Eton
        bridge, we were told to lie flat on the roof and use our feet to prevent
        the boat from hitting the underside of the structure. This plan was
        quickly abandoned when it became clear there was less than six inches of
        clearance. Once through the bridge, however, the rest of the journey
        passed without incident.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        During my time as a Sea Cadet, I had a week at HMS Brawdy, just north of
        Fishguard, in Wales. we were due to fly as a passenger in a buccaneer,
        but light operation would not allow it, so we had a flight in a Wessex
        helicopter, the air sea rescue model, we sat on the floor with a lap
        strap, the pilot took off, and with the large side door open he flew
        around the air field, banking at one point so that all we could see was
        the green grass below us framed in the door way, and the only thing
        stopping us from getting closer to the grass were the lap straps.

      <p class="answer">
        Another Youth Groups in the area was in Bolton Road, this club was open
        every night, and was very successful, I would go a couple of times a
        week, to listen to music and attend the disco on a Saturday night.

      <p class="question">
        Let's take a look at your early work experience. What were your jobs,
        whilst still at school?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I started working at the age of 10, not too short of my 11th birthday,
        our next door neighbour, Peter Brent, was leaving school at Christmas in
        1963, I had just started Secondary School, and he was looking for
        someone to take over the paper round he had, at Rally's, on the corner
        of Vale Road and Maidenhead Road, it's now a house. That first paper
        round took me along vale Road, Buckland Crescent, Hanover Way, Surly
        Hall Walk, Harcourt Road, Smiths Lane and Thames Mead finishing at
        Dedworth Manor. This round was about 30 papers that were delivered
        daily, Friday was always difficult because of the local papers as was
        Sunday, with it's Broadsheets, for this I was paid 7s 6d. I had a couple
        of rounds at Rally's covering Maidenhead road, Sawyers Close and the
        Willows, I remember the pay had increased to 15s as the rounds got
        bigger.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I remember saying to my parents that I was going to give it up, at one
        point, getting up at 6:30 every morning, rain or shine, was getting too
        much, and this was seven days a week, their comment was that was fine,
        but we cannot give you the same money that you are earning. I did give
        up the paper round, but it only lasted a week, I had to get another
        round, at a different shop, I could not deal with only have 2s 6d which
        was all my parents could afford.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I moved from a Paper round to delivering shopping from Davilles, a local
        supermarket, who had a shop on the corner of Vale Road and the Dedworth
        Road, now a Coop store, That was fun, riding a bike with the basket in
        front, full of cardboard boxes, often to a point that you could not see
        over it, quite common in those days. At around this time, I would also
        stand in for Paul Oliver, a neighbour, who had a Saturday job at Shaw’s,
        on the Dedworth Road opposite Manor road, delivery food and also working
        in the shop. I had paper rounds at Clifton’s Opposite Darville's, and
        also at a shop off Clewerhill Road (cannot remember it's name). Also I
        worked for George Carpenter, one evening a week and on Saturdays,
        delivering Greengroceries from his van.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        My final Job, part time, was at the Lyons Teashop on Peascod Street.
        This paid seven guineas a week or £7 7s 0d when I worked five days, that
        had to include the weekend, At this time you could buy a pair of shoes
        for 39s 11d and a gallon of petrol was 5s 0d including purchase tax. bus
        fare from Dedworth to Windsor was 6d, although I used to cycle to the
        Teashop, at that time Peascod Street was Two way traffic, with buses
        going both ways.
      </p>
      <p class="question">Do you remember you first holiday abroad?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes, that would have been in 1965, Dad had been working for BEA for just
        over a year, so was entitled to cheap flights to Europe. We had a weeks
        holiday in Marbella, at the Hotel Guadalpin at that time it was a five
        star hotel. The flight out was interesting, it was a Trident 1, which
        used a very short runway, and then climbed almost vertically to 22,000
        feet, before taking a second climb to 33,000 feet. Not something that
        you can experience today.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        So that takes us to your first job in the real world, how did that fair?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        My working life started in August 1969, having left the Lyons Teashop, I
        started working for Norstel and Templewood Hawksley Limited, on
        Buckingham Avenue Slough, The company manufactured Sewage Bridges and
        scrappers, but is no longer there. I joined the company as a Trainee
        Draughtsman, having secured the position earlier in the year. I had
        about a week at the factory in Slough, before going off to College, full
        time, in Maidenhead, to learn General Mechanical engineering, including
        Draughting, Machine Operation, Welding and Fabrication along with Maths
        and Science. I remember the first week at Maidenhead, we were given our
        timetable, which included Physics, I had not had a good time with
        Physics at school, so was dreading this period, however, on day one, the
        tutor, Mr Jones, went over the basics, at which point everything that I
        had not understood at school, now became crystal clear.<br />
        I returned to the factory when the college had a break, to learn more
        there.<br />
        We were paid weekly, in cash, my first pay packet, when I was at
        college, was sent by post, and arrived on Friday morning, and it did
        every week without fail, and always cash £7 7s 0d, you definitely would
        not get that now.<br />
        I returned to the company full time in the July 1970, and spent time in
        the drawing office, learning the craft, and learning how the Print room
        operated. I also spent some time in their "Erection" department,
        although that came to a sudden end, when one of the engineers asked me
        to get a drawing form the print room, not a copy but the original, and
        got quite upset when I returned empty handed. at that point I returned
        to the Drawing office. It was also during this time, that I started my
        day release at Slough College of Technology. I was only at Norstel and
        Templewood Hawksley Limited for 18 months when I was made redundant, as
        the company was closing.
      </p>
      <p class="question">It was bout this time that you met your now wife</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes, that is correct, it was quite strange really, we met at a nightclub
        "The Birds Nest" at the side of the "Good Companions" Slough, This was
        in early March 1970, and when talking we found out that we both worked
        for the same company, although I was only there during College breaks.
        We got engaged in 1972 and then married in September 1974.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Where did you go after leaving Norstel and Templewood Hawksley?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I managed to get a job at Ideal Capsules, a company that produced the
        foil seals that went on wine bottles and especially Babycham. Here I was
        working in the Drawing office, creating tooling drawings, and Artworks
        for the foil sleeves that were being made, at one point I had to learn
        how to make the screen so that the image could then be transferred on to
        the foils. There was only myself and the Chief Draughtsman, and when he
        moved to another position, I was made redundant, as it was felt I was
        not old enough to be a chief Draughtsman.<br />It was during this time
        that a competition was held in Windsor Home Park, based on a TV show
        called "It's a knockout" and was between companies in Slough, Betty's
        company "Fliteline" were among those competing, and my boss was a member
        of the round table that was organising the competition, It was through
        him I managed to borrow one of the prop, a very large sponge, which just
        about fitted into our A40 farina, with the back seat down and the boot
        lid open. This then allowed the team from fliteline to practise.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        So your early employment seemed to be on a 18 month cycle?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes unfortunately that did seem to be the case, although my next job
        only lasted a month.
      </p>

      <p class="question">What was that job?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        I managed to get a job at Schenkers at Heathrow Airport, as an agent, I
        only lasted there four weeks, I could not deal with the amount of
        freedom I had. I had to visit each airline, a couple of times a day, to
        pick up paperwork, and occasionally a package. I remember having to go
        to Lufthansa one afternoon to pick up a package, the package was not
        available, but I was told to wait for it, at about 4:30, a colleague
        turned up to say he needed to van, to collect the paperwork form the
        other airlines, and that I was to make my way back to the office, on
        foot.
      </p>
      <p class="question">So we then get back into the 18 month cycle?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes that was how it seemed to be, I left Schenkers and went to Satchwell
        Controls, where I was back in the drawing office, drawing Pneumatic
        diagrams and Electrical diagrams for air conditioning systems, After
        about 18 months I left to work for EMI, in Feltham, working on Guided
        Missile systems, my first encounter with Ministry of Defence projects,
        and the need to sign the Official Secrets act. again I stayed at EMI for
        about 18 months. and moved to Crane Packing Limited, back in Slough.
      </p>
      <p class="question">So did Crane Packing change the cycle?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes, here I was drawing Mechanical seals for pumps and factory layouts,
        this was because I was drawing factory layouts when I was at Ideal
        Capsules. After three years I wanted to come off the drawing board, and
        move into Project Engineering, but Crane Packing would not allow that so
        I left and went to work again with Satchwell Controls'
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Was that a little odd, going back to a company that you had previously
        left?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        No, this time it was as a Project Engineer, where I had responsibility
        for overseeing the running of installations around the country. Towards
        the end of 1980 I was moved to the Barbican Centre in London, where the
        HVAC system was coming to its completion, The Barbican centre, was
        something very different to "Normal" sites, this site was constructed,
        close to "London Wall" in the centre of the city, with the lower floor
        being 5 levels down from Street level, the stage was at this level and
        was capable of allowing articulated Trucks to drive on it, and
        turnaround, access was via a lift from street level. also the outer
        walls were constructed of concrete 90ft tick to keep London out of the
        Barbican. I remember on plant room was at the top of the fly tower and
        the only access, at that time was via the scaffolding inside the
        building, I remember climbing up using the stairs that had been included
        for ease but about 3 levels from the top, the stairs changed to ladders.
        I never made it to the plant room.

      <p class="question">What happened next?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        After I left Satchwells I worked for ML Aviation in Slough, where we
        built Runway cratering submunition dispensers, known as JP233, which
        flew under RAF aircraft such as the Tornado. It was here that I started
        dabbling in computers and working with Robotics. During my time at MLA,
        I created a database that allowed the secretaries to complete a task in
        a matter of hours rather that the whole day that it was taking
        originally, and also programming a Robot to drill over a thousand holes
        "blind" into a skinned airframe. This was cutting edge technology at the
        time, The robot, was originally designed to spot weld the body of a
        Vauxhall car, but we replaced the welding gear with a separate robotic
        drilling head. At some point in either 1986 or 87 we were visited by the
        "Tomorrow World" team, from the BBC, to film the Robot in action,
        Unfortunately I cannot find that archive. I know it was broadcast, but I
        cannot remember exactly when.
      </p>
      <p class="question">Why did you leave ML Aviation?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        I had spent a lot of time working on the robot system, but I had also
        been involved in moving the assembly line and office to a new building
        on the Trading Estate, So i transferred to the Maintenance team, as the
        Maintenance Manager, I had been doing the job for a couple of years when
        I was asked to move to a different company, head hunted, if you like, to
        work on a computerised maintenance programme, so I left and went to work
        for a company called CIT, in Slough town centre.
      </p>
      <p class="question">How did that go?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Good question, The job itself, involved me working through a database
        program, that had been purchased directly from it's Norwegian author, to
        Anglicise the text and to create various example databases, and to then
        take the product and demonstrate it to various maintenance departments,
        The job lasted 6 months after which I was made redundant, so not a
        brilliant move from MLA, but I did learn a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="question">So where to next?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        I had a few months of unemployment, the market at that time was very
        difficult, but eventually I secured a maintenance manager position at
        SAFT NIFE in Hampton, about a 35 minute drive from home. here the
        company produced Batteries, which created a whole new technology for me
        This job lasted 6 years, at which time I was made redundant again.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        It seems you were quite unluck with the number of times you were made
        redundant?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes, that was true but it was just one of those things that I had no
        control over.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        So what happened after SAFT NIFE surely things started to improve?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Well I had a few weeks of no employment, and then decided that perhaps
        the answer was to go self employed, so I did that, picking up work as a
        Project Manager, and CAD draughtsman. I did this for a further 6 years,,
        my last contract being for a consultancy in Holburn, but the work was
        for BA at Heathrow.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What was so interesting about the work at BA.?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        The interest started from the time of the interview, it was held in the
        Wells Public House, first time I had ever had an interview in such a
        location, got the contract and started almost immediately at Heathrow,
        working on the Y2K Project.<br />
        At this time, 1998, there was a lot of talk about the impending disaster
        as the clocks clicked over from 1999 to 2000. Our task was to identify
        all Clocks within the BA estate, this being computer clocks mainly or
        devices attached to a computer, All systems were identified and checked
        with a process that rolled the clock forward and back. The interesting
        part was the finding of a hotel, in New York, that was owned by BA, and
        one that they used to put up flight crews, but it was not on any of teh
        listings that we had, so it was not known to the BA estate team. As we
        know, the night went without a hitch. I left the project in February
        2000.
      </p>
      <p class="question">So you had to find another contract?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Yes, although that was a bit of a problem, there was not a great deal of
        work around.
      </p>
      <p class="question">So what did you do?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        After about a month of in activity, Betty suggested I go to a local
        employment agency to see what they had, taking anything really that
        would provide an income. I was not totally convinced, as I had had
        issues years earlier with the state employment office, where they told
        me they had nothing for me as I was a Manager, and they had nothing in
        that line, Anyway, I went along, and sat there computer tests, which I
        passed with no issues. My computer knowledge, at that time was greater
        than there test could reach, however it did result in an interview with
        HP, in Bracknell.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What happened at the interview?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        I went along for the interview in Cann Road, it was for an administrator
        in the Finance department, on 2nd April 2000. The thinking was that if I
        got the job, I could look inside the company for any possible
        opportunities for further work, and hopefully more in line with what I
        had been doing, so Project Management.<br />
        The interview went well, it was in the morning, so by lunchtime, I was
        expecting to be home, however the interview team, had other ideas, and I
        was offered the job, there and then and asked could I start now? I
        stayed at HP for 17 years in total.
      </p>
      <p class="question">Was that as a contractor?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        No, the first two years was as a contractor, I had managed to get a
        contract as a project manager, and after 18 months was able to secure a
        full time roll, working on client projects, installing desktop
        equipment, around 2007 I was able to move to a European team, providing
        sales support for our own data-centre space, this roll I maintained
        until I retired in 2017.
