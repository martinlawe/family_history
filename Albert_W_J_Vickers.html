<p>British <b>Heavy Artillery Corps</b> in the Burma Campaign is a fascinating angle, because the terrain and climate made traditional heavy artillery usage challenging. But they <i>were</i> there, and they played some key roles, especially in the later phases of the war when logistics lines improved.</p>
<b>British Heavy Artillery in Burma (1940–1945):</b><br>
<b>Role and Deployment</b>

<p>Early in the campaign, there was <i>limited use</i> of heavy artillery due to the dense jungle, poor roads, and monsoon conditions.
As the campaign evolved (especially from 1943–1945), heavier guns were brought in to support major offensives like <b>Imphal</b>, <b>Kohima</b>, and the <b>drive to Rangoon</b>.</p>

<p>Artillery was used extensively in <b>defensive fire support</b>, <b>bunker-busting</b>, and in coordinated <b>creeping barrages</b> with infantry advances.</p>
<b>🔹 Units Involved</b><br>

<p><b>Royal Artillery (RA)</b> had multiple heavy and medium artillery regiments attached to the <b>British Fourteenth Army</b> under General Slim.</p>

Units were often rotated and included:<br>
•
<b>Medium Regiments</b>: Typically equipped with 5.5-inch guns.<br>
•
<b>Heavy Regiments</b>: Often had 7.2-inch howitzers or older 60-pounder guns.<br>
•
Artillery support was coordinated under divisional and corps artillery commands (e.g., XXXIII Corps, IV Corps).<b><br><br>
🔹 Equipment Used</b><br>
•
<b>5.5-inch Gun (BL)</b> – Workhorse of medium artillery.<br>
•
<b>7.2-inch Howitzer</b> – Used in heavy regiments; good for deep bombardment.<br>
•
<b>25-pounder field guns</b> were also widely used, but technically not in the “heavy” class—they were the backbone of artillery across all fronts.<b><br>
<p>🔹 Notable Actions</b><br>
•
<b>Battle of Imphal (1944)</b> – Artillery was used effectively in defensive roles, repelling Japanese assaults.<br>
•
<b>Kohima Ridge</b> – Artillery fire played a major role in halting the Japanese advance.<br>
•
During the <b>advance on Meiktila and Mandalay</b>, coordinated barrages were essential in breaking Japanese defenses.<b><br>
<br>🔹 Challenges</b><br>
•
<b>Transporting heavy guns</b> through jungle and mountainous terrain required ingenuity—elephants, bulldozers, and even airlifting in parts.<br>
•
Monsoons turned roads into rivers, limiting mobility and ammo resupply.</p>
