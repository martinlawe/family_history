        <p class="note">
          This family history project began with the goal of preserving our
          shared past â€” not just names and dates, but the stories, decisions,
          and circumstances that shaped each generation. It draws on data
          compiled in RootsMagic, family letters, oral recollections, and wider
          historical research from local and national archives. Some family
          lines trace back centuries, touching on nobility, migration, and
          military service. Others are more modest, telling quiet stories of
          working lives, local ties, and resilience across difficult times. This
          site aims to bring them all together in one place.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          By clicking on a button, above, you will be taken to that family
          history. The top row of buttons, the large ones, group the families
          together. The next row, which are clickable, are the main families
          within that group. the buttons stacked below are the main families for
          which information is available. Some buttons will take you to an
          "Under Construction" page, which means that the detail for that
          particular family, is not available, currently. The buttons an the
          left, give some General Historical Period information, again some may
          take you to an "Under Construction" page, as further information is
          gathered.
