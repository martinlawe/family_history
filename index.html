  <h1>Welcome to Our Family History</h1>
  <p>
    This family history project began with the goal of preserving our shared pastâ€”not just names and dates, 
    but the stories, decisions, and circumstances that shaped each generation. It draws on data compiled in RootsMagic, 
    family letters, oral recollections, and wider historical research from local and national archives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some family lines trace back centuries, touching on nobility, migration, and military service. Others are more modest, telling quiet stories of working lives, local ties, and resilience across difficult times. This site aims to bring them all together in one place.
  </p>

<!-- General notes - things to do next - Reshuffle css file to a more logical sequence
Check button colours, and get things common- Check each tree uses buttons, not links when rendered- 
Once everything is looking consistent, and working Publish to Git.
Look to use Jekyll for templating, hopefully to reduce file sizes.
Add more people files to the project, removing disabled links and buttons.
Create additional Family History pages.
Look to add more photos to relevant person files.
