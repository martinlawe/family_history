  <h1>Welcome to Our Family History</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>This archive brings together the stories of our direct ancestors across the centuries. 
    Each branch explores a different family line, combining narrative history with photos, timelines, and documented records.</p>

    <!--<p>To begin exploring, select one of the family groups below. Within each section, youâ€™ll find blue links to individuals, 
    showing what information we currently have available.</p> -->
  </div>

  <h2>ðŸ“– About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This family history project began with the goal of preserving our shared pastâ€”not just names and dates, 
    but the stories, decisions, and circumstances that shaped each generation. It draws on data compiled in RootsMagic, 
    family letters, oral recollections, and wider historical research from local and national archives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some family lines trace back centuries, touching on nobility, migration, and military service. Others are more modest, 
    telling quiet stories of working lives, local ties, and resilience across difficult times. This site aims to bring them all together in one place.
  </p>
