      <h2> Life and Career of Sir Bernard Brocas</h2>
			<p>Born around 1330 in Clewer, Berkshire, Bernard was the third son of Sir John Brocas, Master of the King's Horse to Edward III. The Brocas family hailed from Gascony, France, and had a long history of service to the English crown. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Bernard's military career was marked by participation in several key battles of the Hundred Years' War, including Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356), and Nájera (1367). He was a close companion of the Black Prince and served as Constable of Aquitaine during the English administration of the region. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In England, Bernard held several important positions. He was appointed Chamberlain to Queen Anne of Bohemia, wife of Richard II, and served as High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1382. He also represented Hampshire in Parliament multiple times between 1367 and 1395. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Bernard died on 20 September 1395 and was buried in St. Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. His tomb features an effigy in full plate armor, and the inscription reads:
			"Here lies Bernard Brocas, soldier, one-time Chamberlain to Queen Anne of England: upon whose soul may God look graciously. Amen."
